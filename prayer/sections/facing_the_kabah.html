<p>When the Messenger of Allāh stood for prayer, he would face the Kaʿbah in both obligatory and voluntary prayers,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and he ordered that, saying to the “one who prayed badly”:<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> When you stand for prayer, perform ablution prefectly, then face the qiblah and say takbīr.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>“During a journey, he would pray voluntary prayers and witr on his mount, wherever it faced carrying him [east or west].”<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The saying of Allāh, the Exalted, “Wherever you turn, there is the Face of Allāh” (Sūrah al–Baqarah, 2:115) applies to this.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>“[Sometimes] when he intended to pray non-obligatory prayers on his she-camel, he would make it face the qiblah, say takbīr, and pray towards wherever his mount turned its face.”<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>“He would make rukūʿ and sajdah on his mount by lowering his head, making the sajdah lower than the rukūʿ.”<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>“When he intended to pray obligatory prayers, he would dismount and face the qiblah.”<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>In prayer during severe fear, he set the example for his Ummah to pray “on foot, standing on their feet, or mounted; facing the qiblah or not facing it,”<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and he also said, “When they (the armies) meet, then it (i.e. the prayer) is takbīr and indication with the head.”<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>He also used to say: “What is between the east and the west is qiblah.”<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Jābir said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once, when we were with the Messenger of Allāh on an expedition, the sky was cloudy, so we tried to find the qiblah but we differed, so each one of us prayed in a different direction, and each of us drew marks in front of him in order to mark our positions. In the morning, we looked at it and found that we had not prayed towards the qiblah. So we mentioned this to the Prophet and he said: “Your prayer was sufficient.”<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“He used to pray towards Bayt al–Muqaddas [with the Kaʿbah in front of him] before the following verse was revealed: ‘We see the turning of your faces to the heavens; now shall we turn you to a qiblah that shall please you: turn then your faces in the direction of the Sacred Mosque (Sūrah al–Baqarah, 2:144).’ When it was revealed he faced the Kaʿbah. There were people at Qubāʾ praying Fajr when someone came to them and said, ‘Verily the Messenger of Allāh has had some of the Qurʾān revealed to him last night and he has been ordered to face the Kaʿbah, [verily] so face it.’ Their faces were towards Shām, so they turned round [and their Imām turned round to face the qiblah along with them].”<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
