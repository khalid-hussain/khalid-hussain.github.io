<p>Next, “he would say takbīr and go down into sajdah,”<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and he ordered “the one who prayed badly” to do so, saying to him, “No one’s prayer is complete unless…he says: Allāh listens to the one who praises Him and stands up straight, then says: ‘Allāh is the Greatest’ and prostrates such that his joints are at rest.”<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Also, “when he wanted to perform sajdah, he would say takbīr, [separate his hands from his sides], and then perform sajdah.”<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Sometimes, “he would raise his hands when performing sajdah.”<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="going-down-into-the-sajdah-on-the-hands"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Going Down into the Sajdah on the Hands</h2>
<p>“He used to place his hands on the ground before his knees.”<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>He used to instruct likewise, saying, When one of you performs sajdah, he should not kneel like a camel, but should place his hands before his knees.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>He also used to say, “Verily, the hands prostrate as the face prostrates, so when one of you places his face (on the ground), he should place his hands, and when he raises it, he should raise them.”<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-sajdah-described"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The Sajdah Described</h2>
<p>“He would support himself on his palms [and spread them],”<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> “put his fingers together,”<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and “point them towards the qiblah.”<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Also, “he would put them (his palms) level with his shoulders,”<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and sometimes “level with his ears.”<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> “He would put his nose and forehead firmly on the ground.”<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>He said to “the one who prayed badly”, “When you prostrate, then be firm in your prostration;”<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> in one narration: “When you prostrate, put your face and hands down firmly, until all of your bones are relaxed in their proper places.”<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>He also used to say, “There is no prayer for the one whose nose does not feel as much of the ground as the forehead.”<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>“He used to put his knees and toes down firmly,”<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> “point with the front of the toes towards the qiblah,”<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> “put his heels together,”<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> “keep his feet upright,”<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and “ordered likewise.”<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Hence, these are the seven limbs on which he would prostrate: the palms, the knees, the feet, and the forehead and nose – counting the last two as one limb in prostration, as he said: “I have been ordered to prostrate (in one narration: we have been ordered to prostrate) on seven bones: on the forehead …” and he indicated by moving his hand<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> around his nose, “the hands (in one version: the palms), the knees and the toes, and not to tuck up<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> the garments and hair.”<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>He also used to say, “When a slave prostrates, seven limbs prostrate with him: his face, his palms, his knees and his feet.”<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>He said about a man who was praying with his hair tied<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> behind him, “His example is surely like that of someone who prays with his hands bound (behind his back).”<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> He also said, “That is the saddle of the devil,” i.e. where the devil sits, referring to the knots in the hair.<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>“He would not rest his forearms on the ground,”<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> but “would raise them above the ground, and keep them away from his sides such that the whiteness of his armpits could be seen from behind,”<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and also “such that if a small lamb or kid wanted to pass under his arms, it would have been able to do so.”<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>He would do this to such an extent that one of his Companions said, “We used to feel sorry for the Messenger of Allāh because of the way he kept his hands away from his sides.”<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>He used to order likewise, saying, “When you perform sajdah, place your palms (on the ground) and raise your elbows<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a>,” and “Be level in sujūd, and none of you should spread his forearms like the spreading of a dog (in one narration: like a dog spreads them)”<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a>. In a separate ḥadīth, “None of you should rest arms on the ground the way a dog rests them.”<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>He also used to say, “Do not spread your arms [the way a beast of prey does], rest on your palms and keep your upper arms apart, for when you do all that, every one of your limbs prostrates with you.”<a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-obligation-to-be-at-ease-in-sujūd"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> The Obligation to be at Ease in Sujūd</h2>
<p>He used to command the completion of rukūʿ and sujūd, comparing someone not doing so to the hungry man who eats one or two dates, which are of no use to him, and also saying about him, “he is indeed one of the worst thieves among the people.”</p>
<p>He also ruled that the prayer of one who does not straighten his spine fully in rukūʿ and sujūd is invalid, as has been mentioned under “Rukūʿ” and ordered “the one who prayed badly” to be at ease in his sujūd, as mentioned before.</p>
<h2 id="the-adhkār-of-sujūd"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> The Adhkār of Sujūd</h2>
<p>He would say any one of the following remembrances of Allāh and supplications in this posture:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><div lang="ar">
سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الْأَعْلَى
</div>
<p>“How Perfect is my Lord, the Most High,” three times.<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Sometimes, “he would repeat it more times than that.”<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Once, he repeated it so much that his sujūd were nearly as long as his standing, in which he had recited three of the Long Sūrahs: al–Baqarah, al–Nisāʾ and Āl ʿImrān. That prayer was full of supplication and seeking of forgiveness, as mentioned before under “Night Prayer.”</p></li>

<h2 id="forbiddance-of-reciting-the-qurʾān-in-sujūd"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Forbiddance of Reciting the Qurʾān in sujūd</h2>
<p>He used to forbid recitation of the Qurʾān in rukūʿ and sujūd, and commanded striving in, and a lot of, supplication in this posture, as explained previously under “Rukūʿ”. He also used to say, “The slave is closest to his Lord when he is prostrating, so increase supplication [in it].”<a href="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="lengthening-the-sajdah"><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Lengthening the Sajdah</h2>
<p>He would make his sujūd about as long as his rukūʿ, and sometimes he would make it extremely long due to the circumstances, as one of his Companions said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Messenger of Allāh came out to us for one of the two later prayers, [Ẓuhr or ʿAṣr,] carrying al–Ḥasan or al–Ḥusayn. The Prophet then came to the front and put him down [next to his right foot], said takbīr for the prayer and commenced praying. During the prayer, he performed a very long prostration, so I raised my head [from among the people], and there was the child, on the back of the Messenger of Allāh , who was in prostration. I then returned to my prostration. When the Messenger of Allāh had offered the prayer, the people said, “O Messenger of Allāh! In the middle of [this] your prayer, you performed a prostration and lengthened it so much that we thought either something had happened, or that you were receiving revelation!” He said, “Neither of those was the case: actually, my son made me his mount, so I did not want to hurry him until he had satisfied his wish.”<a href="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another ḥadīth, “He was praying. When he performed sajdah, al–Ḥasan and al–Ḥusayn jumped onto his back. When the people tried to stop them, he gestured to them to leave the two alone. After offering his prayer, he placed them in his lap and said,”Whoever loves me should love these two.“<a href="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-excellence-of-the-sajdah"><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> The Excellence of the Sajdah</h2>
<p>He used to say, “There is no one among my Ummah whom I will not recognise on the Day of Resurrection.” They said, “How will you recognise them, O Messenger of Allāh, among the multitude of created beings?” He said, “Do you not see that were one of you to enter an enclosure in which there was a jet black<a href="#fn53" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> steed and a horse with a white forehead and legs,<a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> would you not recognise the latter from the former?” They said, “Of course.” He said, “Thus, my Ummah on that day will surely have white faces<a href="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> because of sujūd, and white arms and feet<a href="#fn56" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> because of ablution.<a href="#fn57" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>He would also say, “When Allāh intends to have mercy on whomsoever he wishes of the people of the Fire, He will order the angels to bring out whoever used to worship Allāh; so they will bring them out, recognising them from the marks of sujūd, for Allāh has prohibited the Fire from devouring the marks of sujūd. Thus, they will be brought out from the Fire, for the Fire devours all of a son of Ādam except the marks of sujūd.”<a href="#fn58" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="sajdah-on-the-ground-and-on-matse136"><span class="header-section-number">1.8</span> Sajdah on the Ground, and on Mats<a href="#fn59" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></h2>
<p>He would often prostrate on the (bare) ground.<a href="#fn60" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>“His Companions would pray with him in the intense heat, so when one of them could not press his forehead against the ground, he would spread his robe and prostrate on that.”<a href="#fn61" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>He also used to say, “the whole earth has been made a place of worship (masjid) and a purification for me and my Ummah; so wherever prayer becomes due on someone of my Ummah, he has his place of worship (masjid) and his purification next to him. Those before me used to think that this was too much: indeed, they would only pray in their churches and synagogues.”<a href="#fn62" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>Sometimes, he would prostrate in mud and water, and that happened to him once at dawn on the twenty-first night of Ramaḍān, when it rained and the roof of the mosque, which was made of palm-branches, was washed away. So he prostrated in mud and water; Abū Saʿīd al–Khudrī said, “So I saw, with my own eyes, the Messenger of Allāh , with traces of mud and water on his forehead and nose.”<a href="#fn63" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>Also, “he would pray on a khumrah”<a href="#fn64" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> sometimes, or “on a mat”<a href="#fn65" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> sometimes, and “he prayed on it once when it had become blackened due to prolonged use.”<a href="#fn66" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="rising-from-sajdah"><span class="header-section-number">1.9</span> Rising from Sajdah</h2>
<p>Next, “he would raise his head from prostration while saying takbeer,”<a href="#fn67" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> and he ordered “the one who prayed badly” to do that, saying, “The prayer of any person is not complete until…he prostrates until his limbs are at rest, then he says, ‘Allah is the Greatest’ and raises his head until he is sitting straight.”<a href="#fn68" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Also, “he would raise his hands with this takbīr” sometimes.<a href="#fn69" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>

<p>Next, “he would lay his left foot along the ground and sit on it [relaxed],”<a href="#fn70" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> and he ordered “the one who prayed badly” thus, saying to him, “When you prostrate, prostrate firmly, then when you rise, sit on your left thigh.”<a href="#fn71" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>“He would have his right foot upright,”<a href="#fn72" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> and “point its toes towards the qiblah.”<a href="#fn73" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn3"><p>Abu Yaʿlā in his Musnad (284/2) with a good isnād and Ibn Khuzaymah (1/79/2) with a different, ṣaḥīḥ isnād.<a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Al–Nasāʾī, al–Dāraquṭnī and Mukhlis in <em>al–Fawāʾ’id</em> (1/2/2) with two ṣaḥīḥ isnāds. This raising of the hands has been reported from ten Companions, and a number of the Salaf viewed it as correct, among them Ibn ʿUmar, Ibn ʿAbbās, Ḥasan al–Baṣrī, Tāwūs, his son ʿAbd Allāh, Nāfiʿ the freed slave of Ibn ʿUmar, Sālim the son of Ibn ʿUmar, Qāsim bin Muḥammad, ʿAbd Allāh bin Dīnār and ʿAtāʾ. Also, ʿAbd al–Raḥmān bin Mahdī said, “This is from the Sunnah,” it was practised by the Imām of the Sunnah, Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal, and it has been quoted from Mālik and al–Shāfiʿī.<a href="#fnref4">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Ibn Khuzaymah (1/76/1), al–Dāraquṭnī and Ḥākim, who declared it ṣaḥīḥ and al–Dhahabī agreed. All the aḥādīth which contradict this are inauthentic. This way has been endorsed by Mālik, and similar is reported from Aḥmad in Ibn al–Jawzī’s <em>al–Taḥqīq</em> (108/2). Also, al–Marwazī quoted with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād, Imām al–Awzāʾī in his <em>Masāʾil</em> (1/147/1) as saying, “I found the people placing their hands before their knees.”<a href="#fnref5">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Abū Dāwūd, Tammām in <em>al–Fawāʾid</em>, and al–Nasāʾī in <em>Sunan al–Ṣughrā</em> and <em>Sunan al–Kubrā</em> (47/1) with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād. ʿAbd al–Ḥaqq declared it ṣaḥīḥ in <em>al–Aḥkām</em> (54/1), and went on to say in <em>Kitāb al–Tahajjud</em> (56/1), “it has a sounder isnād than the previous one,” i.e. the ḥadīth of Wāʾil which is the other way round (knees before hands). In fact, the latter ḥadīth, as well as being contradictory to this ṣaḥīḥ ḥadīth and the preceding one, is neither authentic in isnād nor in meaning, as I have explained in <em>Silsilah al–aḥādīth al–Ḍaʿīfah</em> (no. 929) and <em>Irwāʾ al–Ghalīl</em> (357).</p>
<p>It should be known that the way to differ from the camel is to place the hands before the knees, because the camel places its knees first; a camel’s “knees” are in its forelegs, as defined in <em>Lisān al–ʿArab</em> and other books of the Arabic language, and as mentioned by al–Ṭaḥāwī in <em>Mushkil al–Āthār</em> and <em>Sharḥ Maʿānī al–Āthār</em>. Also, Imām Qāsim al–Saraqustī narrated in <em>Gharīb al–Ḥadīth</em> (2/70/1-2), with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād, Abū Hurayrah’s statement, “No one should kneel the way a runaway camel does,” and then added, “This is in sajdah. He is saying that one should not throw oneself down, as a runaway (or untamed) camel does, hurriedly and without calmness, but he should go down calmly, placing his hands first, followed by his knees, and an explanatory marfūʿ ḥadīth has been narrated in this regard.” He then mentioned the ḥadīth above.</p>
<p>As for Ibn al-Qayyim’s extremely strange statement, “These words are incomprehensible, and not understood by the experts of the language,” it is answered by the sources which we have mentioned, and also many others which can be consulted. I have also expanded on this in the refutation against Shaykh Tuwayjarī, which may be published.<a href="#fnref6">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn22"><p>This movement of the hand was deduced from the grammar of the Arabic text (<em>Fath al–Bārī</em>).<a href="#fnref22">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn23"><p>i.e. to draw them in and prevent them from being scattered, meaning to gather the garment or hair with the hands for rukūʿ and sujūd (<em>Nihāyah</em>). This forbiddance is not only during prayer; the majority of scholars include tucking in the hair and garments before prayer in the prohibition. This is further strengthened by his forbidding men to pray with their hair tied, which follows later.<a href="#fnref23">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn27"><p>Muslim, Abū ʿAwānah and Ibn Ḥibbān. Ibn al–Athīr says, “The meaning of this ḥadīth is that were his hair loose, it would fall on the ground when in sajdah; hence, the man would be rewarded for the prostration of the hair. However, if the hair is tied, it is effectively as though it did not prostrate, for he compared him to someone whose hands are shackled together, since they would then not lie on the ground in sajdah.”</p>

<li id="fn58"><p>Al–Bukhārī and Muslim; the ḥadīth shows that the sinful from among those regular at Prayer, will not remain the Fire forever; in fact, even those given to missing prayers out of laziness will not remain in the Fire forever, this is authentic – see <em>Silsilah al–Aḥādīth al–Ṣaḥīḥah</em> (2054).<a href="#fnref58">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn66"><p>Muslim and Abū ʿAwānah. Arabic <em>labisa</em>: usually means ‘to wear,’ but here it is used to mean ‘to use,’ i.e. to sit on; hence ‘wearing’ includes ‘sitting on,’ so this indicates that it is prohibited (ḥarām) to sit on silk, because of the prohibition on wearing it established in the Ṣaḥīḥs of al–Bukhārī and Muslim, and others. In fact, a clear forbiddance of sitting on silk is related in these, so do not be confused by the fact that some leading scholars allow it.<a href="#fnref66">↩</a></p></li>

<p>To raise the hands here, and with every takbīr, was a view voiced by Aḥmad, as in Ibn al–Qayyim’s <em>Badaa’i</em> (3/89): “Athram quoted from him (Imām Aḥmad) that on being asked about raising the hands, he said: ‘With every movement down and up.’ Athram said: ‘I saw Abu ʿAbd Allāh (i.e. Imām Aḥmad) raising his hands in prayer with every movement down and up.’”</p>
<p>This was also the opinion of Ibn al–Mundhir and Abū ʿAlī of the Shāfiʿīs, and also a view of Mālik and al–Shāfiʿī themselves, as in <em>Tarh at–Tathreeb</em>. The raising of the hands here is also authentically reported from Anas bin Mālik, Ibn ʿUmar, Nāfiʿ, Tāwūs, Ḥasan Baṣrī, Ibn Sīrīn and Ayyūb al–Sikhtiānī, as in <em>Musannaf Ibn Abī Shaybah</em> (1/106) with ṣaḥīḥ narrations from them.<a href="#fnref69">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn74"><p>Ibid. Ibn al–Qayyim overlooked this, so after mentioning the Prophet’s iftirāsh between the two sajdahs, he said, “No other way of sitting here is preserved from him!” How can this be correct, when <strong>iqaa</strong> has reached us via: the ḥadīth of Ibn ʿAbbās in Muslim, Abū Dāwūd and al–Tirmidhī, who declared it ṣaḥīḥ, and others (see <em>Silsilah al–Aḥādīth al–Ṣaḥīḥah</em> 383); the ḥadīth of Ibn ʿUmar with a ḥasan isnād in Bayhaqī, declared ṣaḥīḥ by Ibn Ḥajar. Also, Abū Isḥāq al–Ḥarbī related in <em>Gharīb al–Ḥadīth</em> (5/12/1) from Tāwūs, who saw Ibn ʿUmar and Ibn ʿAbbās practising <strong>iqaa</strong>; its sanad is ṣaḥīḥ. May Allāh shower His Mercy on Imām Mālik, who said, “Every one of us can refute and be refuted, except the occupant of this grave,” and he pointed to the grave of the Prophet . This sunnah was practised by several Companions, Successors and others, and I have expanded on this in <em>al–Aṣl</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, this <strong>iqaa</strong> is different to the one which is forbidden, and follows under “Tashahhud.”<a href="#fnref74">↩</a></p></li>

Forgive me…,’ because both of them have been reported from the Prophet between the two sajdahs.” (<em>Masāʾil of Imām Aḥmad and Isḥāq bin Rāhawayh as related by Isḥāq al–Marwazī</em>, p. 19).<a href="#fnref80">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn81"><p>This does not negate the validity of the expressions in the obligatory prayers due to the absence of anything to differentiate between those and voluntary prayers. This is the view of al–Shāfiʿī, Aḥmad and Isḥāq, who held that this was allowed in compulsory and voluntary prayers, as al–Tirmidhī has narrated. Imām al–Ṭaḥāwī has also taken this view in <em>Mushkil al–Āthār</em>. Proper analysis supports this argument, for there is no position in prayer where a dhikr is not valid, and so it is fitting that this should be the case here.<a href="#fnref81">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn89"><p>Al–Bukhārī and Abū Dāwūd. This sitting is known as <em>jalsah al–istirāhah</em> (the sitting of rest) by the scholars of fiqh. Al–Shāfiʿī supported it, as did Aḥmad in <em>Taḥqīq</em> (111/1) and favoured it more strongly, as is well-known of him that he would insist on following a sunnah which had nothing to contradict it. Ibn Hānī said in his <em>Masāʾil of Imām Aḥmad</em> (p. 42), “I saw Abū ʿAbd Allāh (i.e. Imām Aḥmad) sometimes leaning on his hands when standing up for the next rakʿah, and sometimes sitting straight and then getting up.” It was also the preference of Imām Isḥāq bin Rāhawayh, who said in Marwazī’s <em>Masāʾil</em> (1/147/2), “The example was set by the Prophet of supporting himself with his hands when getting up, whether he was old or young.” See also <em>Irwāʾ al–Ghalīl</em> (2/82-3).<a href="#fnref89">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn92"><p>Abū Isḥāq al–Ḥarbī with a faultless sanad, and its meaning is found in Bayhaqī with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad. As for the ḥadīth, “He used to get up like an arrow, not supporting himself with his hands,” it is mawḍū (fabricated), and all narrations of similar meaning are weak, not authentic, and I have explained this in <em>Silsilah al–Aḥādīth al–Ḍaʿīfah</em> (562, 929, 968).<a href="#fnref92">↩</a></p></li>
