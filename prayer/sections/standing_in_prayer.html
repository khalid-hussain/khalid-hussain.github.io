<h1 id="standing-in-prayer"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Standing in Prayer</h1>
<p>He used to stand in prayer for both obligatory and voluntary prayers, carrying out the command of the Exalted: “And stand before Allāh devoutly. (Sūrah al–Baqarah, 2:238)”</p>
<p>As for during a journey, he would pray voluntary prayers on his riding beast.</p>
<p>He set the example for his Ummah to pray during severe fear on foot or while mounted, as has been mentioned, and that is the purpose of the saying of Allāh: “Guard strictly your (habit of) prayers, especially the Middle Prayer,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and stand before Allāh devoutly. If you fear (an enemy) then pray on foot, or while riding. But when you are in security, celebrate Allāh’s praises in the manner He has taught you, which you did not know before. (Sūrah al–Baqarah, 2:238-9)”</p>
<p>He (sallAllāhu ’alaihi wa sallam) prayed sitting during the illness of which he died.“<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He also prayed sitting on another occasion before that, when he was injured, and the people behind him prayed standing; so he indicated to them to sit, so they sat (and prayed). When he finished, he said,”You were going to do as the Persians and the Romans do: stand for their kings who sit. So do not do so, for the Imām is there to be followed: when he makes rukūʿ, make rukūʿ, when he rises, rise; and when he prays sitting, pray sitting [all of you].“<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-prayer-of-a-sick-person-in-a-sitting-position"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> The Prayer of a Sick Person in a Sitting Position</h2>
<p>ʿImrān ibn Ḥusayn said, “I was suffering from haemorrhoids (piles), so I asked the Messenger of Allāh and he said, ‘Pray standing; if you are not able, then sitting down; if you are not able to do so, then pray lying down.’”<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>ʿImrān ibn Ḥusayn also said, “I asked him about the prayer of a man while sitting, so he said: ‘He who prays standing, that is better; he who prays sitting, his reward is half that of the former. He who prays lying down (and in another narration: reclining), has half the reward of the one who sits.’<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> This applies to the sick person, for Anas said,”The Messenger of Allāh came out to the people while they were praying sitting due to illness, so he said: “Verily, the prayer of one who sits is (worth) half of the prayer of the one who stands.”<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<!-- TODO double check the following -->
<p>Once “he visited a sick person and saw him praying (leaning) on a pillow, so he took it and cast it aside. So the man took a stick to pray (leaning) on it, but he took it and cast it aside and said: ‘Pray on the ground if you can, but otherwise make movements with your head, making your sujood lower than your rukoo.’”<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="prayer-on-a-ship"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Prayer on a Ship</h2>
<p>He was asked about prayer on a ship, so he said, “Pray on it standing, unless you are afraid of drowning.”<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>When he grew old he took a support at his place of prayer to lean on.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="sitting-and-standing-in-the-night-prayer-tahajjud"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Sitting and Standing in the Night Prayer (Tahajjud)</h2>
<p>He used to pray long through the night standing, and long through the night sitting, and if he recited standing, he would bow standing, and if he recited sitting, he would bow sitting.“<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Sometimes, “He would pray sitting, so he would recite sitting until about thirty or forty verses of his recitation were left; he would then stand up to recite these standing and then bow and prostrate, and he would do likewise in the second rakaʿah.”<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<!-- TODO check the footnote 25 -->
<p>In fact, “he prayed al–subhah<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> sitting down towards the end of his life when he had grown old, and that was a year before his death.”<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Also “he would sit cross-legged.”<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="prayer-wearing-shoes-and-the-command-to-do-so"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Prayer Wearing Shoes and the command to do so</h2>
<p>“He used to stand (in prayer) bare-footed sometimes and wearing shoes sometimes.”<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>He allowed this for his ummah, saying: “When one of you prays, he should wear his shoes or take them off and put them between his feet, and not harm others with them.”<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>He encouraged prayer wearing them sometimes, saying: “Be different from the Jews, for they do not pray in their shoes nor in their khuffs (leather socks).”<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<!-- TODO come back to the following para -->
<p>Occasionally he would remove them from his feet while in prayer and then continue his prayer, as Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri has said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Messenger of Allāh prayed with us one day. Whilst he was engaged in the prayer he took off his shoes and placed them on his left. When the people saw this, they took off their shoes. When he finished his prayer he said, “Why did you take your shoes off?” They said, “We saw you taking your shoes off, so we took our shoes off.” He said, “Verily Jibrīl came to me and informed me that there was dirt – or he said: something harmful – (in another narration: filth) on my shoes, so I took them off. Therefore, when one of you goes to the mosque, he should look at his shoes: if he sees in them dirt – or he said: something harmful – (in another narration: filth) he should wipe them and pray in them.”<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“When he removed them, he would place them on his left”<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and he would also say: “When one of you prays, he should not place his shoes on his right nor on his left, where they will be on someone else’s right, except if there is no one on his left, but he should place them between his feet.”<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="prayer-on-the-pulpit-minbar"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Prayer on the Pulpit (Minbar)</h2>
<p>“Once he prayed on the pulpit (in another narration: ‘…which had three steps’)<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a>. Hence [he stood on it and said takbīr and the people behind him said takbīr while he was on the pulpit],[then he made rukūʿ on the pulpit], then he rose and descended backwards to make sajdah at the foot of the pulpit. Then he returned, [and did on it as he had done in the first rakʿah], until he completed his prayer. He then turned to the people and said:”O people! I have done this so that you may follow me and learn my prayer.“<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-sutrah36-and-the-obligation-to-have-one"><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> The Sutrah,<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and the Obligation to have one</h2>
<p>“He used to stand near to the sutrah, so that there was (a distance of) three cubits between him and the wall”<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and “between the place of his prostration and the wall, (there was) enough space for a sheep to pass.”<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>He used to say: “Do not pray except towards a sutrah, and do not let anyone pass in front of you, but if someone continues (to try to pass) then fight him, for he has a companion (i.e. a shayṭān) with him.”<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>He would also say: “When one of you prays towards a sutrah, he should get close to it so that Shayṭān cannot break his prayer.”<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Sometimes, “he would seek to pray at the pillar which was in his mosque.”<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>“When he prayed [in an open space where there was nothing to use as sutrah] he would plant a spear in the ground in front of him and pray towards it with the people behind him”;<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Sometimes “he would to set his mount sideways and pray towards it”<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> but this is not the same as prayer in the resting-place of camels,<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> which “he forbade”,<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> and sometimes “he would take his saddle; set it lengthways and pray towards its end.”<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>He would say: “When one of you places in front of him something such as the stick on the end of a saddle, he should pray and not mind anyone who passes beyond it.”<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Once “he prayed towards a tree”<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> and sometimes “he would pray towards the bed on which ʿĀʾishah was lying [under her sheet].”<a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>He , would not let anything pass between him and his sutrah, hence once “he was praying, when a sheep came running in front of him, so he raced it until he pressed his belly against the wall [and it passed behind him].”<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Also, once “while praying an obligatory prayer, he clenched his fist (during it), so when he had finished, the people said: ‘O Messenger of Allāh, did something happen during the prayer?’ He said: ‘No, except that the devil wanted to pass in front of me, so I strangled him until I could feel the coldness of his tongue on my hand By Allāh! Had my brother Sulaimaan not beaten me to it,<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> I would have tied him (the devil) to one of the pillars of the mosque so that the children of Madīnah could walk round him.’ [So whoever can prevent something intervening between him and the qiblah, he must do so].”<a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>He also used to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When one of you prays towards something which is a sutrah between him and the people and someone intends to cross in front of him, then he should push him in the throat [and repel, as much as he can], (in one narration: he should stop him, twice) but if he refuses (to not pass) then he should fight him, for verily he is a devil.<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also used to say: “If the person who passed in front of someone praying knew (the sin) on him, it would be better for him to wait forty than to pass in front (Abū al–Nadr said, ‘I do not remember exactly whether he said forty days, months or years.’)”<a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="what-breaks-the-prayer"><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> What Breaks the Prayer</h2>
<p>He used to say: “A man’s prayer is cut off when there is nothing such as the end of a saddle in front of him, by: a [menstruating]<a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> woman, a donkey or a black dog.” Abū Dharr said, “I said: ‘O Messenger of Allāh, why the black dog rather than the red one?’” He said, “The black dog is a shayṭān.”<a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="prohibition-of-prayer-facing-the-grave"><span class="header-section-number">1.8</span> Prohibition of Prayer Facing the Grave</h2>
<p>He used to forbid prayer facing the grave, saying: “Do not pray towards the graves, and do not sit on them.”<a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn28"><p>al-Bukhārī. The sutrah is a must for the Imām or a person praying alone, even in a large mosque. Ibn Hānī said in his <em>Masāʾil</em> from Imām Aḥmad (1/66): “Abū ʿAbd Allāh (i.e. Imām Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal) saw me one day when I was praying without a sutrah in front of me, and I was in a (large) congregational mosque, so he said to me: ‘Take something as a sutrah’, so I took a man as a sutrah.” This contains an indication that Imām Aḥmad did not differentiate between big or small mosques in taking a sutrah – and that is surely correct, but this is something neglected by most people, including imāms of mosques, in every land that I have visited, including Arabia which I was able to tour in Rajab of this year (1410), so the ʿUlamā should tell the people and advise them of this, explaining its ruling and that it is also required in the Two Sacred Mosques.<a href="#fnref28">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn38"><p>Referring to the following prayer of the Prophet Sulaymān which was answered by Allāh, as described in the Qurʾān: “My Lord! Forgive me, and grant me sovereignty not allowed to anyone after me, for You are indeed the Granter of Bounties. So we subjected to his power: the Wind, gently flowing to his order, wherever he wished; and the devils, every kind of builder and diver, and also others bound together in fetters.” (Sūrah Ṣāḍ, 38:35-38)<a href="#fnref38">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn39"><p>Aḥmad, al-Dāraquṭnī and al-Ṭabarānī with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād, and similar in meaning to this ḥadīth is found in al-Bukhārī and Muslim and others on the authority of several Companions. It is one of the many aḥādīth which the Qādiyānī group disbelieve, for they do not believe in the world of the jinn which is mentioned in the Qurʾān and the Sunnah. Their method of discarding the texts is well-known: if it is from the Qurʾān, they change its meaning e.g. the saying of the Exalted: “Say, it has been revealed to me that a group of jinns listened” (72:1); they say “i.e. a group of humans”! making the word <em>jinn</em> synonymous with “human”! Hence they play with the language and the religion; if it is from the Sunnah, then if it is possible for them to change it with a false interpretation they do so, otherwise they find it easy to declare it to be false, even if all the Imāms of Ḥadīth and the whole Ummah behind them are agreed on its authenticity, nay its being mutawātir.
