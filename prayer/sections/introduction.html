<h1 id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">In the Name of Allāh</span>, the Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</p>
<p>Praise be to Allāh, who made Prayer compulsory on his slaves and ordered them to establish it and perform it well; who linked success and felicity to humility in Prayer; who made it the criterion to distinguish between Īmān and Kufr; and who made it a restrainer from shameful and unjust deeds.</p>
<p>Prayers and peace be upon our Prophet Muḥammad, who was addressed in the Words of the Exalted:</p>
<p>“And We have sent down to you the Message, that you may explain clearly to the people what is sent for them,”<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and who fully carried out this task. The Prayer was one of the most important things which he explained to the people, verbally and practically, even praying on the pulpit once - standing, bowing and prostrating, and then saying to them, “I have done this so that you may follow me and learn my prayer.”<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He obligated us to copy him in his prayer, saying, “Pray as you have seen me praying.”<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He also gave the good tidings to whoever prayed like him that such a person has a covenant with Allāh that He will enter him into the Garden, saying, “There are five prayers which Allāh, Mighty and Sublime, has made compulsory: he who performs ablution well for them, prays them at their proper times, and is complete in their bowings, prostrations and humility, he has a guarantee from Allāh that He will forgive him; but he who does not do so, has no guarantee from Allāh: if He wishes, He will forgive him or if He wishes, He will punish him.”<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Prayers and peace be also on his family and his pious and just Companions, who passed on to us his worship, prayer, sayings and actions , and who made these, and these alone, a madhhab and a path for them to follow; and also on those who follow in their footsteps and tread their path until the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>When I finished reading the book of prayer in <em>al-Targhīb wa al-Tarhīb</em> by al-Ḥāfiẓ al-Mundhirī and teaching it to our brothers, four years ago, it became clear to us all the important position of the Prayer in Islām; and the reward, grace and respect awaiting those who establish and perform it well; and that all this varies, depending on its closeness to the Prophet’s prayer . This is what he indicated in his saying, “Verily the slave prays a prayer of which nothing is written down for him except a tenth, ninth, eighth, seventh, sixth, fifth, quarter, third or half of it.”<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Therefore, I reminded the brothers that it is not possible for us to perform prayer as it should be performed, or even approach that, unless we know the detailed description of the Prophet’s prayer , including its essentials, manners, forms, supplications (duʿā) and remembrances (adhkār), and then we make an effort to put that knowledge into practice carefully, for then we could hope that our prayers would restrain us from shameful and unjust deeds, and that the reward and blessings mentioned in the narrations would be written down for us.</p>
<p>However, detailed familiarity with all these aspects of prayer is unlikely to be achieved by most people nowadays, even many scholars, because of their limiting themselves to a particular madhhab. But, as anyone concerned with assisting in compiling and studying the purified Sunnah knows, in every madhhab there are sunnahs which are not found in other madhhabs; moreover, in every madhhab there are sayings and actions which cannot be authentically traced back to the Prophet – most of these are found in the sayings of the later scholars,<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> many of whom we see firmly attributing these to the Prophet !<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> This is why the scholars of Ḥadīth – may Allāh reward them well – have produced books of takhrīj on the famous books of the later scholars, explaining the rank of each ḥadīth given in them: whether e.g. authentic, weak or fabricated. Examples of these books of takhrīj are: <em>al–ʾInāyah fī Maʿrifah Aḥādīth al–Hidāyah</em> and <em>al–Turuq wa al–Wasāʾil fī Takhrīj Aḥadīth Khulāṣah al–Dalāʾil</em> by Shaykh ʿAbdul Qādir ibn Muḥammad al–Qurashī al–Ḥanafī; <em>Nasb al–Rāyah li Aḥādīth al–Hidāyah</em> by Ḥāfiẓ Zaylaʾī, and its abridged version <em>al–Dirāyah</em> by Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr al–ʿAsqalānī, who also wrote <em>Talkhīs al–Habīr fī Takhrīj Aḥādīth al–Rāfiʾī al–Kabīr</em>; there are many others, naming which will only lengthen this discussion.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="compilation-of-this-book"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Compilation of this book</h2>
<p>Since I had not come across a comprehensive book covering this topic, I felt obliged to produce a book which collected together as many features of the Prophet’s prayer from the takbeer to the tasleem as possible, for the benefit of my Muslim brothers who wished to follow the guidance of their Prophet in their worship, such that it would be easy for any who truly loved the Prophet to use this book to fulfil his command, “Pray as you have seen me praying.”</p>
<p>Thus I embarked on a difficult task, and researched the relevant aḥādīth from the various sources of ḥadīth, the book in your hands being the end result of it all. I stipulated on myself that I would only give aḥādīth which had an authentic sanad according to the principles and regulations of the science of ḥadīth. I disregarded any ḥadīth which depended on unknown or weak narrators, whether it dealt with the outward form, adhkaar, excellence, etc. of the Prayer. This is because I hold that the authentic aḥādīth<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> are sufficient, leaving no need for anything weak, for the latter does not amount to anything except ẓann (conjecture, suspicion), and incorrect conjecture at that; as the Exalted says:</p>
<p>“…and conjecture is of no use against the truth”<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and the Prophet said, “Beware of suspicion, for truly, suspicion is the most false of speech.”<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Therefore, we cannot worship Allāh by acting according to inauthentic aḥādīth; in fact, the Messenger of Allāh forbade us from this saying, “Keep away from saying things about me, except what you know”<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>; since he has forbidden us from relating weak narrations, it goes without saying that it is forbidden to act according to them.</p>
<p>I have compiled the book as two texts: the main text and the subsidiary text.</p>
<p>The main text includes the text of aḥādīth or phrases taken from them, as well as appropriate words to string them together to give the book a fluency from start to finish. I have been careful to preserve the text of each ḥadīth as it is found in the books of Sunnah; where a ḥadīth has different wordings, I have chosen the version which best fits the fluency etc, but I have brought together other wordings thus: “(in one version: …)” or “(in one narration: …)” Only rarely have I given the Companion who narrated the ḥadīth, or explained in the main text which of the Imāms of Ḥadīth have collected each ḥadīth, in order to provide easy reading and reference.</p>
<p>As for the subsidiary text, it is a commentary on the main text. In it I have traced the aḥādīth to their sources, exploring their various versions and routes of narration. Along with this, I have commented on their isnād and supporting narrations, with authenticating and disparaging remarks on narrators, whether authentic or weak, judged according to the rules of the science of ḥadīth. Often, one route of narration has additional words which are not found in other routes, so I have inserted these into the original ḥadīth in the main text whenever it is possible to do so without destroying the fluency, enclosing the addition in square brackets: […], usually without stating which of the sources were alone in containing that addition. This has been done only if the ḥadīth is originally on the authority of the same Companion, otherwise I have given it separately, e.g. in the opening supplications etc. This insertion of additional wordings is a tremendous advantage which you will not find in many books - Praise be to Allāh, by Whose Favor good actions are completed.</p>
<p>Next, I have mentioned in the subsidiary text the madhāhib of the scholars regarding the ḥadīth traced, as well as the evidence and counter-evidence for each view, along with the strengths and weaknesses of each argument. We have then selected out of that the correct view which we have given in the main text. Also in the subsidiary text, we have given some issues for which there is no text in the Sunnah, but which require ijtihād, and do not come under the title of this book.</p>
<p>Since the publication of this book with both main and subsidiary texts is not feasible right now due to various reasons, we have decided to publish only the main text of the book (along with brief footnotes) by Allāh’s Will, and named it <em>Ṣifah Ṣalāh al-Nabī , min al-takbīr ilā at-Taslīm Kaʾannaka Tarāhā</em> (The Prophet’s Prayer Described, from beginning to end, as though you were watching it)“.</p>
<p>I ask Allāh to make this work sincerely for His Face, and to help my brothers in faith to benefit from it, for He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<h2 id="methodology-of-this-book"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Methodology of this book</h2>
<p>Since the purpose of this book is to convey the guidance of the Prophet regarding Prayer, it was elementary that I would not limit myself to a particular madhhab, for the reasons mentioned previously. Therefore, I would give whatever is authentically proved from him , as has always been the way of the scholars of ḥadīth,<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> whether of old or of the recent past,<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> as the excellent saying goes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The People of Ḥadīth are the People of the Messenger, although they accompany him not, they are with his every movement.<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus this book would, Allāh Willing, gather whatever is relevant to each topic from the various contents of the books of ḥadīth and the books on the differences between the madhāhib, such that the correct verdicts found in this book would not be found totally in any one madhhab. Hence the one acting on it, Allāh Willing, would be among those whom Allāh had guided “by His Grace to the Truth concerning that in which they differed, for Allāh guides whom He will to a path that is straight.”<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>When I adopted these principles for myself, i.e. to adhere to the authentic Sunnah, and to implement them in this book as well as others, I knew for sure that this would not satisfy every group of people or sect; in fact, it would result in some, if not most of them, insulting or criticising me. This does not matter to me, for I also know that to please everyone is an unattainable notion, and that “He who pleases the people by angering Allāh, Allāh will entrust him to the people,” as the Messenger of Allāh said.<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The reward is with Allāh for the author of the following lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nor could I ever escape from abuse, Even were I in a cave in a rugged mountain; For who can escape from the people unharmed, Even if he hides behind the eagle’s wings?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is enough for me that I believe that this is the most upright way, which Allāh has commanded the believers to take; which our Prophet Muḥammad , Chief of the Messengers, has explained. This is the path which was trodden by the Pious Predecessors: the Companions, their Successors and those after them, including the four Imāms to whose madhāhib the majority of Muslims today attribute themselves. All of them were agreed on the obligation to stick to the Sunnah and to refer to it; to ignore every view contradictory to it, no matter how great the holder or propounder of that view, for the status of the Messenger of Allāh is far greater, and his example is far truer. Because of this, I have acted on their guidance, followed in their footsteps and carried out their commands to stick to the authentic ḥadīth, even if this opposes their view. These commands of theirs have influenced me greatly in my perusal of this path, and my rejection of blind taqlīd (following of opinion). I ask Allāh the Exalted to reward them greatly.</p>

<p>It would be beneficial if we gave some of these here, for perhaps this will admonish or remind those who follow the opinion of the Imāms - nay, of those far below the Imāms in rank - blindly,<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> sticking to their madhahībs or views as if these had descended from the heavens! But Allāh, Mighty and Sublime, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Follow (O men!) the revelation given to you from your Lord, and follow not, as friends and protectors, other than Him. Little is it you remember of admonition.<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="abū-ḥanīfah"><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Abū Ḥanīfah</h3>
<p>The first of them is Abū Ḥanīfah Nuʿmān ibn Thābit, whose companions have narrated from him various sayings and diverse warnings, all of them leading to one thing: the obligation to accept the ḥadīth, and to give up following the opinions of the Imāms which contradict it:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“When a hadeeth is found to be saheeh, then that is my madhhab.”<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>“It is not permitted<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> for anyone to accept our views if they do not know from where we got them.”<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>In one narration, “It is prohibited<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> for someone who does not know my evidence to give verdicts<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> on the basis of my words.”</p>
<p>Another narration adds, “…for we are mortals: we say one thing one day, and take it back the next day.”</p>
<p>In another narration, “Woe to you, O Yaʿqūb!<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Do not write down everything you hear from me, for it happens that I hold one opinion today and reject it tomorrow, or hold one opinion tomorrow and reject it the day after tomorrow.”<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>“When I say something contradicting the Book of Allāh the Exalted or what is narrated from the Messenger , then ignore my saying.”<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mālik-ibn-anas"><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Mālik ibn Anas</h3>
<p>As for Imām Mālik ibn Anas, he said:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Truly I am only a mortal: I make mistakes (sometimes) and I am correct (sometimes). Therefore, look into my opinions: all that agrees with the Book and the Sunnah, accept it; and all that does not agree with the Book and the Sunnah, ignore it.”<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>“Everyone after the Prophet will have his sayings accepted and rejected – not so the Prophet .”<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Ibn Wahb said: “I heard Mālik being asked about cleaning between the toes during ablution. He said, ‘The people do not have to do that.’ I did not approach him until the crowd had lessened, when I said to him, ‘We know of a sunnah about that.’ He said, ‘What is that?’ I said, ‘Layth ibn Saʿd, Ibn Laheeʿah and ʿAmr ibn al–Hārith narrated to us from Yazīd ibn ʿAmr al–Maʿāfirī from Abū ʿAbd al–Raḥmān al–Hubulī from Mustawrid ibn Shaddād al–Qurashī who said, “I saw the Messenger of Allāh rubbing between his toes with his little finger.”’ He said, ‘This hadeeth is sound; I had not heard of it at all until now.’ Afterwards, I heard him being asked about the same thing, on which he ordered cleaning between the toes.”<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="imām-alshāfiʿī"><span class="header-section-number">1.3.3</span> Imām al–Shāfiʿī</h3>
<p>As for Imām al–Shāfiʿī, the quotations from him are most numerous and beautiful,<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> and his followers were the best in sticking to them:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“The sunnahs of the Messenger of Allāh reach, as well as escape from, every one of us. So whenever I voice my opinion, or formulate a principle, where something contrary to my view exists on the authority of the Messenger of Allāh , then the correct view is what the Messenger of Allāh has said, and it is my view.”<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>“The Muslims are unanimously agreed that if a sunnah of the Messenger of Allāh is made clear to someone, it is not permitted<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> for him to leave it for the saying of anyone else.” <a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>“If you find in my writings something different to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allāh , then speak on the basis of the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allāh , and leave what I have said.”</p>
<p>In one narration: “…then follow it (the Sunnah), and do not look sideways at anyone else’s saying.”<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>“When a ḥadīth is found to be ṣaḥīḥ, then that is my madhhab.”<a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>“You<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> are more knowledgeable about ḥadīth than I, so when a ḥadīth is ṣaḥīḥ, inform me of it, whether it is from Kufa, Basra or Syria, so that I may take the view of the ḥadīth, as long as it is saheeh.”<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>“In every issue where the people of narration find a report from the Messenger of Allāh to be saheeh which is contrary to what I have said, then I take my saying back, whether during my life or after my death.”<a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>“If you see me saying something, and contrary to it is authentically reported from the Prophet , then know that my intelligence has departed.”<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>“For everything I say, if there is something authentic from the Prophet contrary to my saying, then the ḥadīth of the Prophet comes first, so do not follow my opinion.”<a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>“Every statement on the authority of the Prophet is also my view, even if you do not hear it from me.”<a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="imām-aḥmad-ibn-ḥanbal"><span class="header-section-number">1.3.4</span> Imām Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal</h3>
<p>Imām Aḥmad was the foremost among the Imāms in collecting the Sunnah and sticking to it, so much so that he even “disliked that a book consisting of deductions and opinions be written.”<a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Because of this he said:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Do not follow my opinion; neither follow the opinion of Mālik, nor al–Shāfiʿī, nor Awzāʾī, nor Thawrī, but take from where they took.”<a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>In one narration: “Do not copy your Dīn from anyone of these, but whatever comes from the Prophet and his Companions, take it; next are their Successors, where a man has a choice.”</p>
<p>Once he said: “Following<a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> means that a man follows what comes from the Prophet and his Companions; after the Successors, he has a choice.”<a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>“The opinion of Awzāʾī, the opinion of Mālik, the opinion of Abū Ḥanīfah: all of it is opinion, and it is all equal in my eyes. However, the proof is in the narrations (from the Prophet and his Companions).”<a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>“Whoever rejects a statement of the Messenger of Allāh is on the brink of destruction.”<a href="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p></li>
</ol>

<!-- TODO Add something here -->
<p>These are the clear, lucid sayings of the Imāms about sticking to the aḥādīth and forbidding the following of their opinion without clear-cut evidence, such that mere opinion and interpretation is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Hence, whoever adhered to whatever of the Sunnah that was proved authentic, even if it opposed some of the Imāms’ sayings, he would not be conflicting with their madhhab, nor straying from their path; rather, such a person would be following all of them and would be grasping the most trustworthy hand-hold, which never breaks. However, this would not be the case with the one who abandoned any of the authentic Sunnah simply because it contradicted their views; nay, such a person would be being disobedient to them and opposing their above mentioned sayings, while Allāh says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But no, by Your Lord, they can have no (real) faith, until they make you judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against your decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction.<a href="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then let those beware who withstand the Messenger’s order, lest some trial befall them or a grievous penalty be inflicted on them.<a href="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Rajab al–Ḥanbalī says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore it is obligatory on anyone who hears of a command of the Messenger of Allāh or knows it, to explain it to the Ummah, advise them sincerely, and order them to follow his command, even if it contradicts the opinion of someone great. This is because the authority of the Messenger of Allāh has the most right to be respected and followed, over and above the opinion of anyone great who has unknowingly contradicted the Messenger’s command in any matter. This is why the Companions and those after would refute anyone who contradicted the authentic Sunnah, sometimes being very stern in their refutation,<a href="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> not out of hatred for that person, for they loved and respected him, but because the Messenger of Allāh was more beloved to them, and his command was superior to the command of any other created being. Hence, when the order of the Messenger and that of someone else conflicted, the order of the Messenger would be more fitting to be enforced and followed. None of this would stop them respecting the person they had opposed because they knew that he would be forgiven;<a href="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> in fact, the latter would not mind his instruction being opposed when the command of the Messenger of Allāh was clearly shown to be opposite.<a href="#fn53" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, how could they mind that, when they had ordered their followers to do so, as we have seen, and had enjoined on them to abandon any of their views which contradicted the Sunnah. In fact, Imām al–Shāfiʿī told his companions to attribute the authentic Sunnah to him also, even if he had not adopted it or had adopted something contradictory to it. Hence, when the analyst Ibn Daqīq al–ʿEid collected together, in a bulky volume, the issues in which one or more of the four Imāms’ madhāhib had contradicted the authentic ḥadīth, he wrote at the beginning of it, “It is prohibited to attribute these answers to the Mujtahid Imāms, and obligatory on the jurists who follow their opinions to know of these so that they do not quote them regarding these and thus lie against them.”<a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p>Due to all that we have mentioned, the disciples of the Imāms, a number of people from those of old, and a few from those of later time,<a href="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> would not accept all of their Imām’s views; they actually ignored many when they found them to be clearly against the Sunnah. Even the two Imāms, Muḥammad ibn al–Ḥasan and Abū Yūsuf differed from their Shaykh, Abū Ḥanīfah “in about a third of the Madhhab”<a href="#fn56" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a>, as the books of masāʾil prove. Similarly is said about Imām al–Muzanī<a href="#fn57" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> and other followers of al–Shāfiʿī and other Imāms; were we to start giving examples, the discussion would become exceedingly, long, and we would digress from what we set out to do in this <em>Introduction</em>, so we shall limit ourselves to two instances:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Imām Muḥammad says in his Muwaṭṭāʾ<a href="#fn58" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a>(p. 158), “As for Abū Ḥanīfah, he did not regard there being a prayer to ask for rain, but we hold that the Imām prays two rakʿahs and then supplicates and holds out his wrapping garment…”</p></li>
<li><p>We have ʾIsām ibn Yūsuf al–Balkhī, one of the companions of Imām Muḥammad<a href="#fn59" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> and a servant of Imām Abū Yūsuf,<a href="#fn60" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> who “would give verdicts contrary to Imām Abū Ḥanīfah because he did not know the latter’s evidence, and other evidence would present itself to him, so he would give verdicts using that.”<a href="#fn61" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Hence, “he would raise his hands on bowing (in prayer) and on rising from it,”<a href="#fn62" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> as is the mutawātir sunnah of the Prophet ; the fact that his three Imāms (i.e. Abū Ḥanīfah, Abū Yūsuf and Muḥammad) said otherwise did not prevent him from practising this sunnah. This is the approach which every Muslim is obliged to have, as we have already seen from the testimony of the Four Imāms, and others.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To sum up: I sincerely hope that no follower of an Imām will race to condemn the principles of this book and abandon benefiting from the sunnahs of the Prophet which it contains, with the argument that they are contrary to his madhhab. I hope that such a person will instead consider what we have given of the exhortations of the Imāms towards the obligation to act on the Sunnah and ignore their sayings contradictory to it. I hope also that he will realise that to condemn the attitude of this book is to condemn whichever Imām he is following, for we have taken these principles from those Imāms, as we have explained. Therefore, whoever refuses to be guided by them on this path is in great danger, for such refusal necessitates turning away from the Sunnah, the Sunnah to which we have been ordered to refer in cases of difference of opinion and on which we have been commanded to depend.</p>
<p>I ask Allāh to make us among those about whom He says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer of the believers, when summoned to Allāh and His Messenger, in order that he may judge betweeen them, is no other than this: they say, “We hear and we obey” – it is such as these that will attain Success. It is those who obey Allāh and His Messenger, and fear Allāh, and keep their duty to Him, who will triumph.<a href="#fn63" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<h1 id="misconceptions-cleared"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Misconceptions Cleared</h1>
<p>The preceding Introduction was written ten years ago, during which time it has become apparent to us that our words have had a positive effect on Muslim youth in guiding them towards the obligation in matters of their Dīn and worship to return to the pure sources of Islām: the Book and the Sunnah. Among them, there was an increase in the ranks of of those who practised the Sunnah and devoted themselves to it – Praise be to Allāh – such that they became conspicuous for it. However, I still found among some of them a steadfastness in failing to practise the Sunnah: not due to any doubt about its obligation after reading the Qurʾānic verses and narrations from the Imāms about going back to the Sunnah, but because of some objections and misconceptions which they had heard from some muqallid shaykhs. Therefore, I decided to mention these incorrect notions and refute them, so that perhaps ths would encourage more people to practise the Sunnah and thus be among the Saved Sect, Allāh Willing.</p>
<h2 id="misconception-one" class="unnumbered">Misconception One</h2>
<p>Some of them say, “There is no doubt that it is obligatory to return to the guidance of our Prophet in the matters of our Dīn, especially in the recommended acts of worship such as Prayer, where there is no room for opinion or ijtihād, due to their immutable nature. However, we hardly hear any of the muqallid shaykhs propounding this; in fact, we find them upholding difference of opinion, which they regard as flexibility for the Ummah. Their proof for this is the ḥadīth which they repeatedly quote in such circumstances, when refuting the helpers of the Sunnah, ‘The difference of opinion (ikhtilāf) among my Ummah is a mercy (raḥmah).’ It seems to us that this ḥadīth contradicts the principles to which you invite and based on which you have compiled this book and others. So, what do you say about this ḥadīth?”</p>
<p>Answer: The answer is from two angles:</p>
<p>Firstly: This ḥadīth is <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">not authentic</span>; in fact, it is false and without foundation. ʿAllāmah al–Subkī said, “I have not come across an authentic or weak or fabricated chain of narration for it,” i.e. no chain of narrators exists for this “ḥadīth”!</p>
<!-- TODO Make some arrangements for Appendix 1 -->
<p>It has also been related with the wordings: “…the difference of opinion among my Companions is a mercy for you” and “My Companions are like the stars, so whichever of them you follow, you will be guided.” Both of these are not authentic: the former is very feeble; the latter is fabricated. (See [Appendix 1])</p>
<p>Secondly: <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">This ḥadīth contradicts the Glorious Qurʾān</span>, for the āyāt forbidding division in the Dīn and enjoining unity are too well-known to need reminding. However, there is no harm in giving some of them by way of example: Allāh says,</p>
<!-- TODO double check this ayah's translation -->
<blockquote>
<p>…and do not fall into disputes, lest you lose heart and your power depart.<a href="#fn64" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And do not be among those join deities with Allāh, those who split up their Dīn and become sects – each party rejoicing with what it has!<a href="#fn65" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But they will not cease to differ, except those on whom your Lord bestows His Mercy.<a href="#fn66" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, if those on whom your Lord has mercy do not differ, and the people of falsehood differ, how can it make sense that differing is a mercy?!</p>
<p>Hence, it is established that this ḥadīth is not authentic, neither in the chain of narration, nor in meaning; therefore, it is clear and obvious that it cannot be used to justify resistance towards acting on the Book and the Sunnah, which is what our Imāms have commanded us anyway.</p>
<h2 id="misconception-two" class="unnumbered">Misconception Two</h2>
<p>Others say, “If differing in the Dīn is forbidden, what do you say about the differences among the Companions and among the Imāms after them? Is there any distinction between their differing and that of later generations?”</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, there is a big difference between these two examples of differing, which manifests itself in two ways: firstly, in cause; secondly, in effect.</p>
<p>As for the differing among the Companions, that was unavoidable, natural difference of understanding: they did not differ by choice. Other factors of their time contributed to this, necessitating difference of opinion, but these vanished after their era.<a href="#fn67" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> This type of differing is impossible to totally remove and such people cannot be blamed in the light of the above mentioned āyāt because of the absence of the appropriate conditions, i.e. differing on purpose and insisting on it.</p>
<p>However, as for the differing found among the muqallidīn today, there is no overriding excuse for it. To one of them, the proof from the Book and the Sunnah is shown, which happens to support a madhhab other than his usual one, so he puts the proof aside for no other reason except that it is against his madhhab. It is as though his madhhab is the original, or it is the Dīn which Muḥammad brought, while other madhāhib are separate Dīns which have been abrogated! Others take the opposite extreme, regarding the madhāhib – for all their differences – as parallel codes of Law, as some of their later adherents explain<a href="#fn68" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a>: there is no harm in a Muslim taking what he likes from them and leaving what he likes, because they are all valid codes of Law!</p>
<p>Both these categories of people justify their remaining divided by this false ḥadīth, “The differing among my Ummah is a mercy” – so many of them we hear using this as evidence! Some of them give the reason behind this ḥadīth and its purpose by saying that it ensures flexibility for the Ummah! Apart from the fact that this “reason” is contrary to the clear Qurʾānic verses and to the meanings of the Imām’s words mentioned, there is also text fom some Imāms to refute it.</p>
<p>Ibn al–Qāsim said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I heard Mālik and Layth saying about the differing of the Companions of the Messenger of Allāh , “It is not as people say: ‘There is flexibility in it’; no, it is not like that, but it is a matter of some being mistaken and some being correct.”<a href="#fn69" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<!-- TODO check transliteration of the following -->
<p>Ashhab said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mālik was asked about the person who accepted a ḥadīth narrated by reliable people in the authority of the Companions of the Messenger of Allāh : “Do you see any flexibility there?” He said, “No, by Allāh, so that he may be on the truth. Truth can only be one. Two contradictory views, can both be correct?! Truth and right are only one.”<a href="#fn70" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imām al–Muzanī, a companion of Imām al–Shāfiʿī said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Companions of the Messenger of Allāh indeed differed, and some of them corrected others. Some scrutinised others’ views and found fault with them. If all their views had been correct, they would not have done so. ʿUmar ibn al–Khaṭṭāb became angry at the dispute between ّUbayy ibn Kaʿb and Ibn Masʿūd about prayer in a single garment. Ubayy said, “Prayer in one garment is good and fine.” Ibn Masʿūd said, “That is only if one does not have many clothes.” So ʿUmar came out in anger, saying, “Two men from among the companions of the Messenger of Allāh , who are looked up to and learnt from, disputing? Ubayy has spoken the truth and not cared about Ibn Masʿūd. But if I hear anyone disputing about it after this I will do such-and-such to him.”<a href="#fn71" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imām al–Muzanī also said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is the one who allows differing and thinks that if two scholars make ijtihād on a problem and one says, “Ḥalāl,” while the other says, “Ḥarām,” then both have arrived at the truth with their ijtihād! It can be said to such a person, “Is this view of yours based on the sources or on qiyās (analogy)?” If he says, “On the sources,” it can be said, “How can it be based on the sources, when the Qurʾān negates differing?” And if he says, “On analogy,” it can be said, “How can the sources negate differing, and it be allowed for you to reason by analogy that differing is allowed?! This is unacceptable to anyone intelligent, let alone to a man of learning.”<a href="#fn72" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it is said further: “What you have quoted from Imām Mālik that truth is only one, not plural, is contradicted by what is found in <em>al–Madkhal al–Fiqhi by Shaykh Zarqāʾ</em> (1/89), “The Caliphs Abū Jaʿfar al–Manṣūr and later al–Rashīd proposed to select the madhhab of Imām Mālik and his book <em>al-Muwaṭṭāʾ</em> as the official code of Law for the Abbasid empire, but Imām Mālik forbade them from this, saying, “Indeed, the Companions of the Messenger of Allāh differed in the non-fundamental issues and were scattered in various towns, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">but each of them was correct</span>.”</p>
<p>I say: This incident of Imām Mālik is well-known, but his saying at the end, “but each of them was correct” is one for which I find no basis in any of the narrations or sources I have come across,<a href="#fn73" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> by Allāh, except for one narration collected by Abū Nuʿaym in <em>Ḥilyah al–Awliyāʾ</em> (6/332), but with a chain of narrators which includes al–Miqdām ibn Dāwūd who is classified among the weak narrators by al–Dhahabi in <em>al–Ḍuʿafāʾ</em>; not only this, but the wording of it is, “…but each of them was correct in his own eyes.” Hence the phrase “in his own eyes” shows that the narration in <em>al-Madkhal</em> is fabricated; indeed, how could it be otherwise, when it contradicts what has been reported on reliable authority from Imām Mālik that truth is only one and not plural, as we have mentioned, and this is agreed on by all the Imāms of the Companions and the Successors as well as the four Mujtahid Imāms and others. Ibn ʿAbd al–Barr says, “If the conflicting views could both be right, the Salaf would not have corrected each other’s ijtihād, judgments, and verdicts. Simple reasoning forbids that something and its opposite can both be correct; as the fine saying goes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To prove two opposites simultaneously is the most hideous absurity.”<a href="#fn74" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it is said further, “Given that this narration from Imām Mālik is false, why did he forbid al–Manṣūr from bringing the people together on his book <em>al–Muwaṭṭāʾ</em> rather than acceding to the Caliph’s wish?”</p>
<p>I say: The best that I have found in answer to this is what Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Kathīr has mentioned in his <em>Sharḥ Ikhtiṣār ʿUlūm al–Ḥadīth</em> (p.31), that Imām Mālik said, “Indeed the people have come together on, and know of, things which we are not acquainted with.” This was part of the excellence of his wisdom and impartiality, as Ibn Kathīr says.</p>
<p>Hence, it is proved that all differing is bad, not a mercy! However, one type of differing is reprehensible, such as that of staunch followers of the Madhāhib, while another type is not blameworthy, such as the differing of the Companions and the Imāms who succeeded them – May Allāh raise us in their company, and give us the capability to tread their path.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is clear that the differing of the Companions was not like that of the muqallidīn. Briefly: the Companions only differed when it was inevitable, but they used to hate disputes, and would avoid them whenever possible; as for the muqallidīn, even though it is possible in a great many cases to avoid differing, they do not agree nor strive towards unity; in fact, they uphold differing. Hence there is an enormous gulf between these two types of people in their difference of opinion.</p>
<p>This was from the point of view of cause. The difference in effect is more obvious.</p>
<p>The Companions, despite their well- known differing in non-fundamental issues, were extremely careful to preserve outward unity, staying well-away from anything which would divide them and split their ranks. For example, there were among them those who approved of saying the basmalah loudly (in prayer) and those who did not; there were those who held that raising the hands (in prayer) was recommended and those who did not; there were those who held that touching a woman nullified ablution, and those who did not – but despite all that, they would all pray together behind one imām, and none of them would disdain from praying behind an imām due to difference of opinion.</p>
<p>As for the muqallidīn, their differing is totally opposite, for it has caused Muslims to be divided inthe mightiest pillar of faith after the two testifications of faith: none other than the Ṣalāh (prayer). They refuse to pray together behind one imām, arguing that the imām’s prayer is invalid, or at least detestable, for someone of a different madhhab. This we have heard and seen, as others beside us have seen;<a href="#fn75" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> how can it not be, when nowadays some famous books of the madhāhib rule such cases of invalidity or detestability. The result of this has been that you find four miḥhrābs (alcoves) in some large congregational mosques, in which four imaams successively lead the Prayer, and you find people waiting for their imām while another imām is already standing in prayer!</p>
<p>In fact, to some muqallidīn, the difference between the madhāhib has reached a worse state than that, such as a ban in marriage between Ḥanafīs and Shāfiʿīs; one well known Ḥanafī scholar, later nicknamed Muftī al–Thaqalayn (The Muftī of Humans and Jinn), issued a fatwā allowing a Ḥanafī man to marry a Shāfiʿī woman, because “her position is like that of the People of the Book!”<a href="#fn76" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> This implies – and implied meanings are acceptable to them – that the reverse case is not allowed, i.e. a Ḥanafī woman marrying a Shāfiʿī man, just as a Muslim woman cannot marry a Jew or Christian!</p>
<p>These two examples, out of many, are enough to illustrate to anyone intelligent the evil effects of the differing of the later generations and their insistence upon it, unlike the differing of the earlier generations (the Salaf), which did not have any adverse effect on the Ummah. Because of this, the latter are exempt from the verses prohibiting division in the Dīn, unlike the later generations. May Allāh guide us all to the Straight Path.</p>
<p>Further, how we wish that the harm caused by such differing be limited to among themselves and not extend to the other peoples being given daʿwah, for then it would not be that bad, but it is so sad when they allow it to reach the non-believers in many areas around the world, and their differing obstructs the entry of people in large numbers into the Dīn of Allāh! The book <em>ّّّẒalām min al–Gharb</em> by Muḥammad al–Ghazzālī (p. 200) records the following incident,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It so happened during a conference held at the University of Princeton in America that one of the speakers raised a question, one which is a favourite of the Orientalists and the attackers of Islām: “Which teachings do the Muslims advance to the world in order to specify the Islām towards which they are inviting? Is it Islāmic teachings as understood by the Sunnis? Or is it as understood by the Imāmī or Zaydī Shīʿahs? Moreover, all of these are divided further amongst themselves, and further, some of them believe in limited progression in thought, while others believe obstinately in fixed ideas.” The result was that the inviters to Islām left those being invited in confusion, for they were themselves utterly confused.<a href="#fn77" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the preface to <em>Hadiyyah al-Sulّṭān ilā Muslimī Bilād al-Yābān</em> by ʿAllāmah Sulṭān al-Maʿṣūmī, the author says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A query was posed to me by the Muslims from Japan, from the cities of Tokyo and Osaka in the far east, “What is the actual Dīn of Islām? What is a madhhab? Is it necessary for one ennobled by the Dīn of Islām to adhere to one of the four Madhhabs? That is, should he be Mālikī, Ḥanafī, Shāfiʿī or Ḥanbalī, or is it not necessary?” This was because a major differing, a filthy dispute, had occured here, when a number of groups of Japanese intellectuals wanted to enter into the Dīn of Islām, and be ennobled by the nobility of Īmān. When they proposed this to some Muslims present in Tokyo, some people from India said, “It is best that they choose the Madhhab of Abū Ḥanīfah, for he is the Lamp of the Ummah”; some people from Indonesia (Java) said, “No, they should be Shāfiʿī!” So when the Japanese heard these statements, they were extremely perplexed and were thrown off their original purpose. Hence the issue of the madhhabs became a barrier in the path of their accepting Islām!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="misconception-three" class="unnumbered">Misconception Three</h2>
<p>Others have the idea that what we invite to, of following the Sunnah and not accepting the views of the Imāms contrary to it, means to completely abandon following their views and benefiting from their opinions and ijtihād.</p>
<p>Answer: This idea is as far as can be from the truth – it is false and obviously flawed, as is clearly evident from our previous discussion, all of which suggests otherwise. All that we are calling to is to stop treating the madhhab as a Dīn, placing it in the position of the Qurʾān and the Sunnah, such that it is referred to in the case of dispute or when extracting a new judgment for unexpected cirumstances, as the so-called jurists of this age do when setting new rules for personal matters, marriage, divorce, etc, instead of referring to the Qurʾān and the Sunnah to distinguish the right from the wrong, the truth from falsehood – all of this on the basis of their “Differing is a mercy” and their idea of pursuing every concession, ease and convenience! How fine was the saying of Sulaymān al–Taymī:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Were you to accept the concessions of every scholar, you would gather every evil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Related by Ibn ʿAbd al–Barr in <em>Jāmiʿ Bayān al–ʿIlm</em> (2/91- 91), who said after it, “There is ijmāʿ (consensus of opinion) on this: I know of no contrary view.”</p>
<p>All this pursuing of concessions for the sake of it is what we reject, and it agrees with ijmāʿ, as you see.</p>
<p>As for referring to the Imāms’ views, benefiting from them, and being helped by them in understanding the truth where they have differed and there is no text in the Qurʾān and the Sunnah, or when there is need for clarification, we do not reject it. In fact, we enjoin it and stress upon it, for there is much benefit expected in this for whoever treads the path of being guided by the Qurʾān and the Sunnah. ʿAllāmah Ibn ʿAbd al–Barr says (2/182),</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hence, my brother, you must preserve the fundamentals and pay attention to them. You should know that he who takes care over preserving the sunnahs and the commandments stated in the Qurʾān, considers the views of the jurists to assist him in his ijtihād, open up different angles of approach and explain sunnahs which carry different possible meanings, does not blindly follow the opinion of anyone of them the way the Sunnah should be followed without analysis, nor ignores what the scholars themselves achieved in preserving and reflecting on the sunnahs, but follows them in discussion, understanding and analysis, is grateful to them for their efforts through which they have benefited him and alerted him about various points, praises them for their correct conclusions, as in the majority of cases, but does not clear them of errors just as they did not clear themselves: such is the pursuer of knowledge who is adhering to the way of the pious predecessors; such is the really fortunate and truly guided; such is the follower of the Sunnah of his Prophet , and the guidance of the Companions. But he who refrains from analysis, forsakes the method we have mentioned, disputes the sunnahs with his opinion and desires to accommadate them only where his own view allows: such a one is straying and leading others astray. Furthermore, he who is ignorant of all we have mentioned, and plunges carelessly into giving verdicts without knowledge: such a one is even more blind, and on a path more astray.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="misconception-four" class="unnumbered">Misconception Four</h2>
<p>There exists another common misconception among muqallidīn which bars them from practising the Sunnah which it is apparent to them that their madhhab is different to it in that issue: they think that practising that sunnah entails faulting the founder of the madhhab. To them, finding fault means insulting the Imām; if it is not allowed to insult any individual Muslim, how can they insult one of their Imāms?</p>
<p>Answer: This reasoning is totally fallacious, and borne of not understanding the Sunnah; otherwise, how can an intelligent Muslim argue in such a way?!</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allāh himself said, “When the one making a judgment strives his outmost and arrives at the correct result, he has two rewards; but if he judges, striving his utmost and passes the wrong judgment, he has one reward.”<a href="#fn78" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> This ḥadīth refutes the above argument and explains lucidly and without any obscurity that if someone says, “So-and-so was wrong,” its meaning under the Sharīʿah is “So-and-so has one reward.” So if he is rewarded in the eyes of the one finding fault, how can you accuse the latter of insulting him?! There is doubt that this type of accusation is baseless and anyone who makes it must retract it: otherwise it is he who is insulting Muslims, not just ordinary individuals among them, but their great Imāms among the Companions, Successors the subsequent Mujtahid Imāms and others. This is because we know for sure that these illustrious personalities used to fault and refute each other;<a href="#fn79" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> is it reasonable to say, “They used to insult each other”? No! In fact, it is authentically-reported that the Messenger of Allāh himself faulted Abū Bakr in his interpretation of a man’s dream, saying to him, “You were right in some of it and wrong in some of it”<a href="#fn80" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> – so did he insult Abū Bakr by these words?!</p>
<p>One of the astonishing effects this misconception has on its holders is that it prevents them from following the Sunnah when it is different to their madhhab, since to them practising it means insulting the Imām, whereas following him, even when contrary to the Sunnah, means respecting and loving him! Hence they insist on following his opinion to escape from this supposed disrespect.</p>
<p>These people have forgotten – I am not saying: …pretended to forget – that because of this notion, they have landed in something far worse than that from which they were fleeing. It should be said to them, “If to follow someone means that you are respecting him, and to oppose him means that you are insulting him, then how do you allow yourselves to oppose the example of the Prophet and not follow it, preferring to follow the Imām of the Madhhab in a path different to the Sunnah, when the Imām is not infallible and insulting him is not Kufr?! If you interpret opposing the Imām as insulting him, then opposing the Messenger of Allāh is more obviously insulting him; in fact, it is open Kufr, from which we seek refuge with Allāh!” If this is said to them, they cannot answer to it, by Allāh, except one retort which we hear time and time again from some of them: “We have left this sunnah trusting in the Imām of the Madhhab, and he was more learned about the Sunnah than us.”</p>
<p>Our answer to this is from many angles, which have already been discussed at length in this Introduction. This is why I shall briefly limit myself to one approach, a decisive reply by the permission of Allāh. I say:</p>
<p>The Imām of your Madhhab is not the only one who was more learned about the Sunnah than you: in fact, there are dozens, nay hundreds, of Imāms who too were more knowledgeable about the Sunnah than you. Therefore, if an authentic sunnah happens to differ from your madhhab, and it was taken by one of these other Imāms, it is definitely essential that you accept this sunnah in this circumstance. This is because your aforementioned argument is of no use here, for the one opposing you will reply, “We have accepted this Sunnah trusting in our Imām, who accepted it” – in this instance, to follow the latter Imām is preferable to following the Imām who has differed from the Sunnah.</p>
<p>This is clear and not confusing to anyone, Allāh Willing.</p>
<p>Because of all of the above, I am able to say:</p>
<p>Since this book of ours has collected the authentic sunnahs reported from the Messenger of Allāh about the description of his Prayer, there is no excuse for anyone to not act on it, for there is nothing in it which the scholars have unanimously rejected, as they would never do. In fact, in every instance several of them have adopted the authentic sunnah; any one of them who did not do so is excused and rewarded once, because the text was not conveyed to him at all, or it was conveyed but in such a way that to him it did not constitute proof, or due to other reasons which are well-known among the scholars. However, those after him in front of whom the text is firmly established have no excuse for following his opinion; rather, it is obligatory to follow the infallible text.</p>
<p>This message has been the purpose of this Introduction. Allāh, Mighty and Sublime, says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O you who believe! Give your response to Allāh and His Messenger when he calls you to that which will give you life, and know that Allāh comes in between a man and his heart, and it is He to whom you shall all be gathered.<a href="#fn81" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allāh says the Truth; He shows the Way; and He is the Best to Protect and the Best to Help. May Allāh send prayers and peace on Muḥammad, and on his family and his Companions. Praise be to Allāh, Lord of the Worlds.</p>

<li id="fn4"><p>Mālik, Abū Dāwūd, al–Nasā’ī, and Ibn Ḥibbān. A ṣaḥīḥ ḥadīth, declared ṣaḥīḥ by several Imāms. I have given its takhrīj in <em>Ṣaḥīḥ Abī Dāwūd</em> (#451, #1276).<a href="#fnref4">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Ṣaḥīḥ – collected by Ibn al–Mubārak in <em>al–Zuhd</em> (10/21/1-2), Abū Dāwūd and al–Nasāʾī with a good sanad; I have given its takhrīj in <em>Ṣaḥīḥ Abī Dāwūd</em> (#761).<a href="#fnref5">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Abū al–Ḥasanāt al–Lucknowī says in <em>al–Nāfiʿ al–Kabīr liman yutāliʿ al–Jāmiʿ al–Saghīr</em> (p. 122-3), after ranking the books of Ḥanafī fiqh and saying which of them are dependable and which are not: “All that we have said about the relative grades of these compilations is related to their content of fiqh issues; however, as for their content with regards to aḥādīth of the Prophet , then it does not apply, for many books on which the cream of the fuqahāʾ rely are full of fabricated aḥādīth, let alone rulings of the scholars. It is clear to us from a broad analysis that although their authors were otherwise competent, they were careless in their quotation of narrations.”</p>
<p>One of these false, fabricated aḥādīth which are found in some of the best books is: “He who offers the compulsory prayers on the last Friday of Ramaḍān, that will make up for every prayer he missed during his life up to the age of seventy years!” Lucknowī says in <em>al–Āthār al–Marfūʿah fi al–Akhbār al–Mawḍūʿah</em> (p. 315), after giving this ḥadīth, “ʿAlī al–Qārī says in his <em>al–Mawḍūʿāt al–Sughrāh</em> and <em>al–Kubrā</em>: this is totally false, for it contradicts the ijmāʾ (consensus) that one act of worship cannot make up for those missed over years. Hence, there is no point in quoting the author of <em>al–Nihāyah</em> nor the rest of the commentators on <em>al–Hidāyah</em>, for they are not scholars of Ḥadīth, nor did they reference this ḥadīth to any of the collectors of ḥadīth.”</p>
<p>Imām al–Shawkānī also mentioned this ḥadīth in <em>al–Fawāʾid al–Majmūʿah fi al–Aḥādīth al–Mawḍūʿah</em> with a similar wording and then said (p. 54), “This is fabricated beyond doubt – I do not even find it in any of the compilations of fabricated aḥādīth! However, it has become popular among some students of fiqh in the city of Ṣanʿāʾ in this age of ours, and many of them have started acting according to it. I do not know who has fabricated it for them – May Allāh disgrace the liars.”</p>
<p>Lucknowī further says, “To establish that this ḥadīth, which is found in books of rituals and formulas, is fabricated, I have composed a brief essay, with intellectual and narrated evidence, called <em>Repelling the Brethren from the Inventions of the Last Friday of Ramaḍān</em>, in which I have filed points which will enlighten minds and to which ears will hearken, so consult it, for it is valuable in this topic and of high quality.”</p>
<p>The occurrence of similar false aḥādīth in the books of fiqh destroys the reliability of other aḥādīth which they do not quote from dependable books of ḥadīth. The words of ʿAlī al-Qārī contain an indication towards this: a Muslim must take aḥādīth from the people who are experts in that field, as the old Arabic sayings go, “The people of Makkah know its mountain paths best” and “The owner of the house knows best what is in it.”<a href="#fnref6">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Imām al–Nawawī’s words in <em>al–Majmūʿ Sharḥ al–Muhadhdhab</em> (1/60) can be summed up as follows: “The researching scholars of the People of Ḥadīth and others say that if the ḥadīth is weak, it will not be said regarding it, ‘The Messenger of Allāh said/did/commanded/forbade…’ or any other phrase designating certainty, but instead it will be said, ‘It is reported/quoted/narrated from him…’ or other phrases suggesting uncertainty. They say that phrases of certainty are for ṣaḥīḥ and ḥasan aḥādīth, and phrases of uncertainty are for anything else. This is because phrases designating certainty mean that what follows is authentic, so they can only be used in the case of what is authentic, otherwise one would effectively be lying about him .</p>
<p>This convention is one ignored by most of the fuqahāʾ of our age, in fact, by most scholars of any discipline, except for the skilled muḥaddithīn. This is disgusting carelessness, for they often say about a ṣaḥīḥs ḥadīth, ‘It is reported from him that…,’ and about a ḍaʿīf one, ‘he said’ and ‘so- and-so reported…,’ and this is far from correct.”<a href="#fnref7">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>Publisher’s note: Also in this category are the works of our teacher, author of <em>Irwāʾ al–Ghalīl fi takhrīj Manār al–Sabīl</em> in 8 volumes, and <em>Ghāyah al–Marām fi takhrīj aḥādīth al–Ḥalāl wa al–Harām</em>, a takhrīj of the aḥādīth found in Dr. Yūsuf al–Qaraḍāwi’s, <em>The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam</em> (which contains many ḍaʿīf aḥādīth).<a href="#fnref8">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>The term, “authentic ḥadīth” includes ṣaḥīḥ and ḥasan in the eyes of the muḥaddithīn, whether the ḥadīth is ṣaḥīḥ li dhātihī or ṣaḥīḥ li ghayrihī, or ḥasan li dhātihī or ḥasan li ghayrihī.<a href="#fnref9">↩</a></p></li>

<p>Later, I discovered that this ḥadīth is actually ḍaʿīf: I had relied on Manāwī in declaring ṣaḥīḥ the isnād of Ibn Abī Shaybah, but then I happened to come across it myself, and found that it was clearly weak, being the same isnād as al–Tirmidhī and others – see my book <em>Silsilah al–Aḥādīth al–Ḍaʿīfah</em> (1783). However, its place is taken by the Prophet’s saying, “He who relates from me a saying which he knows is a lie is indeed one of the liars,” collected by Muslim and others.<a href="#fnref12">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>ʿAbd al–Ḥayy al–Lucknowī says in <em>Imām al–Kalām fīmā yataʿallaq bi al–Qirāʾah Khalf al–Imām</em> (p. 156), as follows: “Whoever dives into the oceans of fiqh and the fundamentals of jurisprudence with an open mind, and does not allow himself to be prejudiced, will know with certainty that in most of the principal and subsidiary issues in which the scholars have differed, the madhhab of the scholars of ḥadīth is firmer than other madhāhib. Every time I go into the branches of difference of opinion, I find the view of the muḥaddithīn nearest to justice – their reward is with Allāh, and He will thank them. How could it be otherwise, when they are the true inheritors of the Prophet , and the sincere agents of his Law; may Allāh include us in their company and make us die loving them.”<a href="#fnref13">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>Subkī says in <em>al–Fatāwā</em> (1/148): “The most important affair of the Muslims is the Prayer, which every Muslim must care about and ensure its performance and the establishment of its essentials. Related to Prayer are issues on which there is consensus and there is no escaping the truth, and other issues in which the scholars have differed. The correct approach is either to keep clear of dispute if possible, or to look for what is authentically proven from the Prophet and adhere to that. When one does this, his Prayer will be correct and righteous, and included in the words of the Exalted, “So whoever expects to meet his Lord, let him work correct, righteous deeds.” (Sūrah al–Kahf, 18:110)</p>
<p>I say: The latter approach is superior, nay, obligatory; this is because the former approach, as well as being impossible for many issues, does not fulfil his command , “Pray as you have seen me praying,” but instead leads to one’s prayer being decidedly different to that of the Prophet .<a href="#fnref14">↩</a></p></li>

Ibn ʿĀbidīn quoted from <em>Sharḥ al–Hidāyah</em> by Ibn al–Shahnah al–Kabīr, the teacher of Ibn al–Humām, as follows:</p>
<p>“When a ḥadīth contrary to the Madhhab is found to be ṣaḥīḥ, one should act on the ḥadīth, and make that his madhhab. Acting on the ḥadīth will not invalidate the follower’s being a Ḥanafī, for it is authentically reported that Abū Ḥanīfah said, ‘When a ḥadīth is found to be ṣaḥīḥ, then that is my madhhab,’ and this has been related by Imām Ibn ʿAbd al–Barr from Abū Ḥanīfah and from other imāms.”</p>
<p>This is part of the completeness of the knowledge and piety of the Imāms, for they indicated by saying this that they were not versed in the whole of the Sunnah, and Imām Shāfiʿī has elucidated this thoroughly (see later). It would happen that they would contradict a sunnah because they were unaware of it, so they commanded us to stick to the Sunnah and regard it as part of their Madhhab. May Allāh shower His mercy on them all.<a href="#fnref20">↩</a></p></li>

The last narration was collected by ʿAbbās al–Dawrī in <em>al–Tārīkh</em> by Ibn Maʿīn (6/77/1) with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad on the authority of Zafar, the student of Imām Abū Ḥanīfah. Similar narrations exist on the authority of Abū Ḥanīfah’s companions: Zafar, Abū Yūsuf and ʿĀfiyah ibn Yazīd; cf. <em>Īqāẓ al–Himam</em> (p. 52). Ibn al-Qayyim firmly certified its authenticity on the authority of Abū Yūsuf in <em>Iʿlām al–Mūqiʿīn</em> (2/344). The addition to the second narration is referenced by the editor of <em>Īqāẓ al–Himam</em> (p. 65) to Ibn ʿAbd al–Barr, Ibn al–Qayyim and others.</p>
<p>If this is what they say of someone who does not know their evidence, what would be their response to one who knows that the evidence contradicts their saying, but still gives verdicts opposed to the evidence?! Therefore, reflect on this saying, for it alone is enough to smash blind following of opinion; that is why one of the muqallid shaykhs, when I criticised his giving a verdict using Abū Ḥanīfah’s words without knowing the evidence, refused to believe that it was a saying of Abū Ḥanīfah!<a href="#fnref22">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn26"><p>This was because the Imām would often base his view on qiyās (analogy), after which a more potent analogy would occur to him, or a ḥadīth of the Prophet would reach him, so he would accept that and ignore his previous view. Shaʿrānī’s words in <em>al–Mīzān</em> (1/62) are summarised as follows:</p>
<p>“Our belief, as well as that of every researcher into Imām Abū Ḥanīfah, is that, had he lived until the recording of the Sharīʿah, and the journeys of the Preservers of Ḥadīth to the various cities and frontiers in order to collect and acquire it, he would have accepted it and ignored all the analogies he had employed. The amount of qiyās in his madhhab would have been just as little as that in other madhāhib, but since the evidences of the Sharīʿah had been scattered with the Successors and their successors, and had not been collected in his lifetime, it was necessary that there be a lot of qiyās in his madhhab compared to that of other Imāms. The later scholars then made their journeys to find and collect aḥādīth from the various cities and towns and wrote them down; hence, some aḥādīth of the Sharīʿah explained others. This is the reason behind the large amount of qiyās in his madhhab, whereas there was little of it in other madhāhib.”</p>
<p>Abū al–Ḥasanāt al–Lucknowī quoted his words in full in <em>al–Nāfiʿ al–Kabīr</em> (p. 135), endorsing and expanding on it in his footnotes, so whoever wishes to consult it should do so there.</p>
<p>Since this is the justification for why Abū Ḥanīfah has sometimes unintentionally contradicted the authentic aḥādīth – and it is a perfectly acceptable reason, for Allāh does not burden a soul with more than it can bear – it is not permissible to insult him for it, as some ignorant people have done. In fact, it is obligatory to respect him, for he is one of the Imāms of the Muslims through whom this Dīn has been preserved and handed down to us, in all its branches; also, for he is rewarded under any circumstance: whether he is correct or wrong. Nor is it permissible for his devotees to continue sticking to those of his statements which contradict the authentic aḥādīth, for those statements are effectively not part of his madhhab, as the above sayings show. Hence, these are two extremes, and the truth lies in between. “Our Lord! Forgive us, and our brethren who came before us into the Faith; and leave not, in our hearts, any rancour against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed Full of Kindness, Most Merciful.” (Sūrah al-Ḥashr, 59:10)<a href="#fnref26">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn27"><p>Al–Fullāni in <em>Īqāẓ al–Himam</em> (p. 50), tracing it to Imām Muḥammad and then saying, “This does not apply to the mujtahid, for he is not bound to their views anyway, but it applies to the muqallid.”</p>
<p>Shaʿrānī expanded on that in <em>al–Mīzān</em> (1/26): “If it is said: ‘What should I do with the aḥādīth which my Imām did not use, and which were found to be authentic after his death?’ The answer which is fitting for you is: ‘That you act on them, for had your Imām come across them and found them to be authentic, he would have instructed you to act on them, because all the Imāms were captives in the hand of the Sharīʿah.’ He who does so will have gathered all the good with both his hands, but he who says, ‘I will not act according to a ḥadīth unless my Imām did so,’ he will miss a great amount of benefit, as is the case with many followers of the Imāms of the Madhāhib. It would be better for them to act on every ḥadīth found to be authentic after the Imām’s time, hence implementing the will of the Imāms; for it is our firm belief about the Imāms that had they lived longer and come to know of those ahaadeeth which were found authentic after their time, they would have definitely accepted and acted according to them, ignoring any analogies they may have previously made, and any views they may have previously held.”<a href="#fnref27">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn29"><p>This is well known among the later scholars to be a saying of Imām Mālik.

<p>al–Nawawī says: “Our companions acted according to this in the matter of tathwīb (calling to prayer in addition to the adhān), the conditions on coming out of iḥrām due to illness, and other issues well-known in the books of the Madhhab. Among those of our companions who are reported to have passed judgment on the basis of the ḥadīth (i.e. rather than the saying of al–Shāfiʿī) are Abū Yaʿqūb al–Buwītī and Abū al–Qāsim al–Dārikī. Of our companions from the muḥaddithīn, Imām Abū Bakr al–Bayhaqī and others employed this approach. Many of our earliest companions, if they faced an issue for which there was a ḥadīth, and the madhhab of al–Shāfiʿī was contrary to it, would act according to the ḥadīth and give verdicts based on it, saying, ‘The madhhab of al–Shāfiʿī is whatever agrees with the hadeeth.’ Shaykh Abū ʿAmr (Ibn al–Ṣalāḥ) says, ‘Whoever among the al–Shāfiʿīs found a ḥadīth contradicting his Madhhab, he would consider whether he fulfilled the conditions of ijtihād generally, or in that particular topic or issue, in which case he would be free to act on the ḥadīth; if not, but nevertheless he found it hard to contradict the ḥadīth after further analysis, he would not be able to find a convincing justification for opposing the ḥadīth. Hence, it would be left for him to act according to the ḥadīth if an independent imām other than Imām al–Shāfiʿī had acted on it, and this would be justification for his leaving the Madhhab of his Imām in that issue.’ What he (Abū ʿAmr) has said is correct and established. Allāh knows best.”</p>
<p>There is another possibility which Ibn al–Ṣalāḥ forgot to mention: what would one do if he did not find anyone else who acted according to the ḥadīth? This has been answered by Taqī al–Dīn al–Subkī in his article, <em>The Meaning of al–Shāfiʿī’s’ saying, “When a ḥadīth is found to be ṣaḥīḥ, then that is my madhhab”</em> (p. 102, vol. 3): “For me, the best thing is to follow the ḥadīth. A person should imagine himself in front of the Prophet , just having heard it from him: would there be leeway for him to delay acting on it? No, by Allāh…and everyone bears a responsibility according to his understanding.”</p>
<p>The rest of this discussion is given and analysed in <em>Iʿlām al–Muwaqqiʿīn</em> (2/302, 370) and in the book of al–Fullānī, <em>Īqāẓ Himam ūlu al–Abṣār, li al–Iqtidāʾ bi Sayyid al–Muhājirīn wa al–Anṣār, wa Taḥdhīruhum ʿan al–Ibtidāʿ al–Shāʾiʿ fī al–Qurā wa al–Amṣār, min Taqlīd al–Madhāhib maʿ al–Ḥamiyyah wa al–ʿAṣabiyyah bayn al–Fuqahāʾ al–Aʿṣār</em> (Awakening the Minds of those who have Perception, towards following the Leader of the Emigrants and Helpers, and Warning them against the Innovation Widespread among Contemporary Jurists in the Towns and Cities, of following Madhāhīb with Zeal and Party-Spirit).

This is why Ibn al–Qayyim attributed it definitely to him in <em>Iʿlām</em> (2/325), as did al–Fullāni in <em>Īqāẓ al–Himam</em> (p. 152) and then said: “Bayhaqī said, ‘This is why he – i.e. al–Shāfiʿī – used ḥadīth so much, because he gathered knowledge from the people of Hijāz, Syria, Yemen and Iraq, and so accepted all that he found to be authentic, without leaning towards or looking at what he had considered out of the Madhhab of the people of his land when the truth was clear to him elsewhere. Some of those before him would limit themselves to what they found in the Madhhab of the people of their land, without attempting to ascertain the authenticity of what opposed it. May Allāh forgive all of us.’”<a href="#fnref38">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn51"><p>Even against their fathers and learned men, as al–Ṭaḥāwī in <em>Sharḥ Maʿānī al–Āthār</em> (1/372) and Abū Yaʿlā in his <em>Musnad</em> (3/1317) have related, with an isnād of trustworthy men, from Sālim ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUmar, who said: “I was sitting with Ibn ʿUmar in the masjid once, when a man from the people of Syria came to him and asked him about continuing the ʿUmrah onto the Ḥajj (known as Ḥajj al–Tamattuʿ).” Ibn ʿUmar replied, “It is a good and beautiful thing.” The man said, “But your father (i.e. ʿUmar ibn al–Khaṭṭāb) used to forbid it!” So he said, “Woe to you! If my father used to forbid something which the Messenger of Allāh practised and commanded, would you accept my father’s view, or the order of the Messenger of Allāh ?” He replied, “The order of the Messenger of Allāh .” He said, “So go away from me.” Aḥmad (no. 5700) related similarly, as did al–Tirmidhī (2/82) and declared it ṣaḥīḥ.</p>
<p>Also, Ibn ʿAsākir (7/51/1) related from Ibn Abī Dhiʾb, who said:</p>
<p>“Saʿd ibn Ibrāhīm (i.e. the son of ʿAbd al–Raḥmān ibn ʿAwf) passed judgment on a man on the basis of the opinion of Rabīʿah ibn Abū ʿAbd al–Raḥmān, so I informed him of the saying of the Messenger of Allāh which was contradictory to the judgment. Saʿd said to Rabīʿah, ‘We have Ibn Abī Dhiʾb, whom I regard to be reliable, narrating from the Prophet contrary to what I ruled.’ Rabīʿah said to him, ‘You have made your effort, and your judgment has been passed.’ Saʿd said, ‘Most amazing! I enforce the decree of Saʿd, and not the decree of the Messenger of Allāh ! No, I shall withdraw the decree of Saʿd, son of the mother of Saʿd, and enforce the decree of the Messenger of Allāh .’ So Saʿd called for the written decree, tore it up and gave a new verdict.”<a href="#fnref51">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn52"><p>In fact, he would be rewarded, because of the Prophet’s saying : “When a judge passes judgment, if he makes his effort (ijtihād) and rules correctly, he will have two rewards; if he makes his effort (ijtihād) and rules wrongly, he will have one reward.” (Related by al–Bukhārī, Muslim and others.)<a href="#fnref52">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn57"><p>He himself says at the beginning of his <em>Concise Shāfiʿī Fiqh</em> (printed in the margin of Imām al–Shāfiʿī’s <em>al–Umm</em>): “This book is a selection from the knowledge of Muḥammad ibn Idrīs al–Shāfiʿī and from the meanings of his sayings, to aid the understanding of whoever wants it, knowing of his forbidding the following of his, or anyone else’s, opinion, so that such a person may carefully look for his Dīn in it.”<a href="#fnref57">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn58"><p>In which he has explained his opposing his Imām in about twenty masāʾil (nos. 42, 44, 103, 120, 158, 169, 172, 173, 228, 230, 240, 244, 274, 275, 284, 314, 331, 338, 355, 356 - from _Taʿlīq al–Mumajjid ʿalā Muwaṭṭāʾ Muḥammad (Important Notes on Muḥammad’s Muwaṭṭāʾ))<a href="#fnref58">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn62"><p><em>Al–Fawāʾid</em>…(p. 116); the author then added a useful note:</p>
<p>“From this can be deduced the falsity of Makhūl’s narration from Abū Ḥanīfah: ‘that he who raises his hands during Prayer, his Prayer is ruined,’ by which Amīr, the scribe of Iṭqānī, was deceived, as has been mentioned under his biography. ʿIṣām ibn Yūsuf, a companion of Abū Yūsuf, used to raise his hands, so if the aforementioned narration had any foundation, Abū Yūsuf and ʿIṣām would have known about it. It can also be deduced that if a Ḥanafī ignored the madhhab of his Imām in an issue due to the strength of the evidence against it, this would not take him outside the ranks of the Imām’s followers, but this would in fact be proper taqlīd in the guise of leaving taqlīd; do you not see that ʿIṣām ibn Yūsuf left Abū Ḥanīfah’s madhhab of not raising the hands, but he is still counted as a Ḥanafī? To Allāh I complain of the ignorance of our time, when they insult anyone who does not follow his Imām in an issue because of the strength of evidence against it, and expel him from the fold of that Imām’s followers! This is not surprising when those who do this are from the ordinary masses, but it is amazing when it comes from those who imitate men of learning but plod along that path like cattle!”<a href="#fnref62">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn77"><p>I now say: Muḥammad al–Ghazzālī’s recent writings such as his newly-released book entitled <em>al–Sunnah al–Nabawiyyah bayna Ahl al–Ḥadīth wa Ahl al–Fiqh</em> (The Prophetic Sunnah between the People of Ḥadīth and the People of Fiqh) have confirmed that he himself is one of those inviters to Islām who are “themselves utterly confused”! His writings have for long betrayed his confusion, his distortion of the Sunnah, and his using his intellect to authenticate or falsify aḥādīth, not by turning to the principles and science of ḥadīth, nor to the experts of that field; instead, whatever appeals to him, he authenticates, even if it is weak, and declares unreliable whatever is not to his liking, even if it is agreed to be authentic!</p>
<p>His above approach is shown most obviously in his discussion of the aḥādīth in his previous book <em>Fiqh al–Sīrah</em>, where he explains his methodology of accepting unreliable aḥādīth and discarding authentic ones on the basis of the text of the ḥadīth alone, from which the reader can see that the objective criticism of ḥadīth has no value in his eyes if it contradicts a “reasoned analysis,” which varies enormously from person to person, for what is truth to one is falsehood to another! Thus the whole of Islām becomes subject to personal whims, having no principles nor reference points except personal opinion; this is poles apart from the position of the early leading ʿUlamā of Islām, “that the Isnād is part of the religion; were it not for the Isnād, people would have said whatever they wished.”</p>
<p>His latest above-mentioned book has exposed to the people his Muʿtazilite methodology, his blatant disregard for the Imāms of Ḥadīth and their efforts over the ages in serving the Sunnah, and distinguishing the genuine traditions from the unreliable ones, and his lack of appreciation of the efforts of the Imāms of Fiqh in their laying down principles and developing issues on that basis, for he takes from these and leaves from them whatever he wishes, with no consistency towards any set of principles or fundamentals!<a href="#fnref77">↩</a></p></li>
