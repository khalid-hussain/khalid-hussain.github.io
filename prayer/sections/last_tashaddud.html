<p>Next, after completing the fourth rakʿah, he would sit for the last tashahhud. He would instruct regarding it, and do in it, just as he did in the first tashahhud, except that “he would sit mutawarrikan,”<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> “with his left upper thigh on the ground, and both his feet protruding from one (i.e. the right) side.”<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> “He would have his left foot under his (right) thigh and shin,”<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> “his right foot upright”<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> or occasionally “he would lay it along the ground.”<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> “His left palm would cover his (left) knee, leaning heavily on it.”<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Once, “he heard a man supplicating in his prayer without glorifying the majesty of Allāh Exalted, nor sending prayers on the Prophet , so he said:”This man has been hasty.&quot; He then called him and said to him and others, “When one of you prays, he should begin with the praise of his Lord, Sublime and Mighty, and his exultation, and then send prayers (in one narration: he should send prayers) on the Prophet , and then supplicate as he wishes.”<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Also, “he heard a man glorifying and praising Allāh, and sending prayers on the Prophet in prayer, so the Messenger of Allāh said to him:”Supplicate, and you will be answered; ask, and you will be given.“<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>It should be known that this ḥadīth proves that ṣalāh (sending prayers) on the Prophet in this tashahhud is obligatory, due to the command about it. This opinion was taken by Imām al-Shāfiʿī and by Imām Aḥmad in the later of the two narrations from him, and before them by several Companions, as well as other people of knowledge. Because of this, Ājūrī said in <em>Sharīʿah</em> (p. 415): “He who does not send prayers on the Prophet in the final tashahhud must repeat the prayer.” Hence, those who label Imām al-Shāfiʿī as being alone and odd in his opinion on this, are not being just, as the faqīh Haytamī has explained in <em>Darr al–Mandūd</em> (sections 13-16).<a href="#fnref7">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn12"><p>We have not said, “…in his tashahhud” because the text is “…in his prayer,” not specifying either tashahhud or anything else. Hence, it covers all positions suitable for supplication, e.g. prostration and tashahhud; the instruction to supplicate in these two postures has been mentioned.<a href="#fnref12">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>Al–Bukhārī and Muslim. Athram said, “I asked Aḥmad: ‘With what (words) should I supplicate after tashahhud?’ He said, ‘As has been narrated.’ I said, ‘Didn’t the Messenger of Allāh say, “Then he should select whichever supplication he likes”?’ He said, ‘He should select out of what has been narrated.’ I repeated the question: he said, ‘From what has been narrated.’” This was quoted by Ibn Taymiyyah (<em>Majmūʿ al–Fatāwā</em> 69/218/1), who endorsed it, adding, “Hence, ‘whichever supplication’ refers to the supplications which Allāh loves, not to any supplication…;” later he said, “Hence, it is best to say: (one should supplicate) with the approved, established supplications, and these are what have ben narrated and those that are beneficial.” This is so, but to recognise which supplications are indeed beneficial depends on authentic knowledge, and this is rarely found among the people, so it is best to stick to the supplications quoted, especially when they include what the worshipper wishes to request. Allāh knows best.<a href="#fnref13">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn15"><p><em>maghram</em>: burden; here it means debt, as proved by the rest of the ḥadīth, in which ʿĀʾishah said, “Someone said to him, ‘Why do you seek refuge from maghram, so often, O Messenger of Allāh?’ He replied, ‘Truly, when a man becomes indebted, he speaks and lies, and he promises and breaks his promise.’”<a href="#fnref15">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn23"><p><em>dandanah</em>: to speak such the intonation is audible, but the words are incomprehensible – in the case, the quiet words of supplication. The final statement means, “Our words are like yours.”<a href="#fnref23">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn26"><p>This is tawassul (a seeking of approach) to Allāh through His most beautiful names and attributes, and this is what Allāh the Exalted commands: “To Allāh belong the most beautiful names, so call on Him by them.” (Sūrah al–Aʿrāf, 7:180). As for seeking to approaching Allāh through other things, e.g. for so-and-so’s sake, or by so-and-so’s right, status, dignity, etc. there is text from Imām Abū Ḥanīfah and his companions that such a practice is at least disliked (makrūh); in general it is prohibited (ḥarām). Therefore, it is a pity that one sees most of the people, among them many shaykhs, totally neglecting the approved tawassul — you will never hear them approaching Allāh this way — but they are well-versed in innovated forms of tawassul, which are at the very least debatable, as though no other way is allowed! Shaykh al–Islām Ibn Taymiyyah has composed an extremely good essay on this subject entitled <em>Tawassul and Wasīlah</em> (“Approaching Allāh, and the Means of doing so”), which should be consulted, for it is very important, and there is little to compare with it in its coverage. There is also my article <em>Tawassul – its types and its rulings</em>, which is also important in its subject-matter and format, and also refutes some of the latest misconceptions advanced by contemporary doctors of religion. May Allāh guide us and them.<a href="#fnref26">↩</a></p></li>
