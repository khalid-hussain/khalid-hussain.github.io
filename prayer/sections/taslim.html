<p>“Peace and Allāh’s Mercy be on you [such that the whiteness of his left cheek was visible].”<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَم وَرَحْمَةُ اللَّهِ

<p>‘Peace and Allāh’s Mercy be on you’ to his right, he would sometimes shorten the greeting on his left to:</p>

<p>‘Peace be on you.’“<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>‘Peace be on you’[in front of his face, turning to his right side a bit],[or a little].“<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>“They used to gesture with their hands when saluting to the right and left; when the Messenger of Allāh saw them, he said, ’What is the matter with you, gesturing with your hands as if they are the tails of wild horses?! When one of you salutes, he should look towards his companion and not indicate with his hand. [So when they prayed with him, they did not gesture.] (In one narration: It is enough for each of you to place his hand on his thigh, and then salute his brothers who are on his right and left).<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>This is the last of what has been possible to compile regarding the description of the Prophet’s prayer from the takbīr to the taslīm: I hope that Allāh will make it sincerely for His Face, Full of Honour, and a guide to the Sunnah of His kind and merciful Prophet.</p>

<p>Glorified be Allāh, and Praised. Glorified be You, O Allāh, and Praised. I bear witness that there is no true god except You. I seek forgiveness from You and repent to You.</p>

اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ، وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، وبَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ، وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ ، كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ و بَارَكْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ، وَآلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ

<p>O Allāh! send prayers on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad, and send blessings on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad, as You sent prayers on Ibrāhīm and the family of Ibrāhīm; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn2"><p>Abū Dāwūd and Ibn Khuzaymah (1/87/2) with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad. ʿAbd al–Ḥaqq also declared it ṣaḥīḥ in his <em>Aḥkām</em> (56/2), as did al–Nawawī and Ibn Ḥajar. It was also transmitted via another route by ʿAbd al–Razzāq in his <em>Musannaf</em> (2/219), Abū Yaʿlā in his <em>Musnad</em> (3/1253), al–Ṭabarānī in <em>Muʿjam al–Kabīr</em> (3/67/2) and <em>Muʿjam al–Awsaṭ</em> (no. 4476 – my numbering) and al–Dāraquṭnī.<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>

Its takhrīj is given in <em>Irwāʾ al–Ghalīl</em> under ḥadīth no. 327.<a href="#fnref4">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Muslim, Abū ʿAwānah, Sirāj, Ibn Khuzaymah and al–Ṭabarānī.</p>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">NB</span>: The ʿIbāḍiyyah have distorted this ḥadīth: their scholar Rabīʿ has related it in his unreliable <em>Musnad</em> with a different wording to justify their view that raising the hands with takbīr invalidates the Prayer! That wording is false, as I have explained in <em>Silsilah al–Aḥādīth al–Ḍaʿīfah</em> (6044).<a href="#fnref5">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Al–Ḥākim and al–Dhahabī declared it ṣaḥīḥ; it has already been given in full under the opening “Takbīr.”<a href="#fnref6">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>The first supplication is the fullest form of the duʿāʾ known as <em>kaffārah al–majlis</em> (expiation of the gathering); “he who says it in a gathering of Remembrance (of Allāh), it will be like a seal to stamp it with, and he who says it in a gathering of vain talk, it will be an expiation for it” – authentically related by al–Ḥākim and al–Ṭabarānī. The second supplication is, of course, from the Sunnah of sending peace and mercy on the Messenger. These two supplications are thus the best way of implementing the following Islamic guideline: “No people sit in a gathering in which they do not mention Allāh, nor send prayers on the Prophet, without it being a source of regret for them; if Allāh wishes, He will punish them, or if He wishes, he will forgive them” – authentically related by al–Tirmidhī, al–Ḥākim and Aḥmad. See Shaykh al–Albānī’s <em>Silsilah al–Aḥādīth al–Ṣaḥīḥah</em> (74-81) for details.<a href="#fnref7">↩</a></p></li>
