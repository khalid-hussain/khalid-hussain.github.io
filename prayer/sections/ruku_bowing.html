<p>After completing his recitation, he would pause for a moment,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> then raise his hands<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> in the way described earlier under the “Opening Takbīr,” say takbīr,<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and make rukūʿ.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>He also ordered “the one who prayed badly” likewise, saying to him, “Indeed, the prayer of one of you is not complete until he makes an excellent ablution as Allāh has commanded him to…then he celebrates Allāh’s greatness, praises and glorifies Him, then recites the Qurʾān as much as is easy for him from what Allāh has taught him and allowed him, then says takbīr and makes rukūʿ [and places his hands on his knees] until his joints are at ease and relaxed.”<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-rukūʿ-described"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> The Rukūʿ Described</h2>
<p>“He would place his palms on his knees,”<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and “would order them to do likewise,”<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> as he ordered “the one who prayed badly” in the aforementioned ḥadīth.</p>
<p>“He would put his hands firmly on his knees [as though he were grasping them],”<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and “would space his fingers out,”<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> ordering “the one who prayed badly” likewise, saying: “When you make rukūʿ, place your palms on your knees, then space your fingers out, then remain (like that) until every limb takes its (proper) place.”<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>“He used to spread himself (i.e. not be in a compact position), and keep his elbows away from his sides.”<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>“When he made rukūʿ, he would spread his back and make it level,”<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> “such that if water were poured on it, it (the water) would stay there (i.e. not run off).”<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> He also said to “the one who prayed badly,” “When you make rukūʿ, put your palms on your knees, spread your back (flat) and hold firm in your rukūʿ.”<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>“He would neither let his head droop nor raise it (i.e. higher than his back),”<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> but it would be in between.<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-obligation-of-being-at-ease-in-rukūʿ"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The Obligation of Being at Ease in Rukūʿ</h2>
<p>He used to be at ease in his rukūʿ, and ordered “the one who prayed badly” to be so, as has been mentioned in the first section on rukūʿ.</p>
<p>He used to say, “Complete the rukūʿ and sujūd, for by Him in whose Hand is my soul, I surely see you behind my back<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> when you make rukūʿ and sujūd.”<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<!-- TODO double check the following -->
<p>“He saw a man praying not completing his rukūʿ properly, and pecking in his sujood, so he said, ‘Were this man to die in this state, he would die on a faith other than that of Muḥammad, [pecking in his prayer as a crow pecks at blood; he who does not make rukūʿ completely and pecks in his sujūd is like the hungry person who eats one or two dates, which are of no use to him at all.]’<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Abū Hurayrah said, “My close friend forbade me from pecking in my prayer like a cockerel, from looking around like a fox, and from squatting like a monkey.”<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The Messenger of Allāh also used to say, “The worst thief among men is the one who steals from his prayer.” They said, “O Messenger of Allāh, how does he steal from his prayer?” He said, “He does not complete its rukūʿ and sujūd.”<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Once, “he was praying, when he glanced out of the corner of his eye at a man not settling his backbone in rukūʿ and sujūd. When he finished, he said, ‘O assembly of Muslims! Verily, the prayer is not valid of the one who does not settle his spine in rukūʿ and sujūd.’”<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>He said in another ḥadīth, “The prayer of a man does not count unless he straightens his back in rukūʿ and sujūd.”<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-adhkār-of-rukūʿ"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> The Adhkār of Rukūʿ</h2>
<p>He would say different types of remembrance of Allāh and supplication, any one of the following at a time:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><div lang="ar">
سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الْعَظِيمِ
</div>
<p>“How Perfect is my Lord, the Supreme!,” three times.<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> But sometimes, he would repeat it more than that.<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Once, in night prayer, he repeated it so much that his rukūʿ became nearly as long as his standing before it, in which he had recited three of the Long Sūrahs: al–Baqarah, al–Nisāʾ and Āl ʿImrān. This prayer was full of supplication and seeking forgiveness, and the ḥadīth has already been mentioned under “Recitation in Night Prayer.”</p></li>
<li><div lang="ar">
سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الْعَظِيمِ وبِحَمْدِهِ

<li><div lang="ar">

<p>“How Perfect You are O Allāh, and Praises are for You. O Allāh, forgive me.” He would say it often in his rukūʿ and sujūd, implementing (the order of) the Qurʾān.<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p></li>
<li><div lang="ar">

</ol>
<h2 id="lengthening-the-rukūʿ"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Lengthening the Rukūʿ</h2>
<p>“He used to make his rukūʿ, his standing after rukūʿ, his sujūd, and his sitting in between the two sajdahs, nearly equal in length.”<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="forbiddance-of-reciting-the-qurʾān-in-rukūʿ"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Forbiddance of Reciting the Qurʾān in Rukūʿ</h2>
<p>“He used to forbid recitation of the Qurʾān in rukūʿ and sujūd.”<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Further, he used to say, “Verily, I have indeed been forbidden from reciting the Qurʾān in rukūʿ or sujūd. In the rukūʿ, therefore, glorify the Supremity of the Lord, Mighty and Sublime, in it; as for the sujūd, exert yourselves in supplication in it, for it is most likely that you will be answered.<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p>Next, “he would straighten up his back out of rukūʿ, saying,</p>
<div lang="ar">

</div>
<p>‘Allāh listens to the one who praises Him.’<a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>He also ordered ‘the one who prayed badly’ to do that, when he said to him: No person’s prayer is complete until…he has said takbīr…then made rukūʿ…then has said ‘Allāh listens to the one who praises Him’ until he is standing straight.“<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> When he raised his head, he would stand straight until every vertebra returned to its place.<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Next, “he would say while standing:</p>
<div lang="ar">

</div>
<p>‘Our Lord, [and] to You be all Praise.’“<a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>He has commanded all worshippers, whether behind an imām or not, to do the above on rising from rukūʿ, by saying “Pray as you have seen me praying.”<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>He also used to say, “The imām is there to be followed…when he has said ‘Allāh listens to the one who praises Him’ then say, ‘[O Allāh!] Our Lord, and to You be all Praise;’ Allāh will listen to you, for indeed, Allāh, Blessed and Exalted, has said via the tongue of His Prophet : Allāh listens to the one who praises Him.’”<a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>He also gave a reason for this command in another ḥadīth, saying: “for he whose saying coincides with that of the angels will have his past sins forgiven.”<a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>He used to raise his hands when straightening up,<a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> in the ways described under the “Opening Takbīr.”</p>
<p>While standing, he would say, as previously-mentioned,</p>

<p>“O Allāh!…”<a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>He used to order others to do this, saying, “When the imām says: ‘Allāh listens to the one who praises Him,’ then say: ‘O Allāh! Our Lord, to You be all Praise,’ for he whose saying coincides with that of the angels will have his past sins forgiven.”<a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p></li>

“…Filling the heavens, [filling] the earth, whatever is between them, and filling whatever else You wish.”<a href="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></li>

<p>A man praying behind him said this after he had raised his head from rukūʿ and said: “Allāh listens to the one who praises Him.” When the Messenger of Allāh had finished his prayer, he said, “Who was the one speaking just now?” The man said, “It was I, O Messenger of Allāh.” So the Messenger of Allāh said, “I saw over thirty angels hurrying to be the first one to write it down.”<a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p></li>

It is the madhhab of the three Imāms Mālik, al–Shāfiʿī and Aḥmad, and of the majority of scholars of ḥadīth and fiqh. Imām Mālik practised it right up to his death, as reported by Ibn ʿAsākir (15/78/2). Some of the Ḥanafīs chose to do it, among them ʿIṣām bin Yūsuf Abū ʿAsamah al–Balkhi (d. 210), a student of Imām Abū Yūsuf, as has been explained in the Introduction. ʿAbd Allāh bin Aḥmad reported from his father in his <em>Masāʾil</em> (p. 60), “It is related from ʿUqbah bin ʿĀmir that he said about a man raising his hands during prayer, ‘He earns ten good deeds for each such movement.’” This is supported by the ḥadīth qudsī, “…he who intends a good deed and then does it, Allāh writes it down with Himself as from ten to seven hundred good deeds,” transmitted by al–Bukhārī and Muslim.

<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Note</span>: Is there proof for combining two or more of these adhkār in one rukūʿ, or not ? The scholars have differed about this. Ibn al-Qayyim was uncertain about this in <em>Zād al–Maʿād</em>. Al–Nawawī chose the first possibility in <em>al–Adhkār</em>, saying, “It is best to combine all of these adhkār if possible, and similarly with the adhkār of other postures.” Abū al–Tayyib Siddīq Ḥasan Khān disagreed with him, saying in <em>Nuzul al–Abrār</em> (84), “It is narrated with one of them here, another one there, but I see no evidence for combining. The Messenger of Allāh would not combine them in one go, but he would say one of them sometimes, another one sometimes; to follow is better than to start something new.” This latter view is the correct one, Allāh willing, but it is proved in the Sunnah to lengthen this posture, as well as others, until it is about the length of the standing: hence, if the worshipper wishes to follow the Prophet in this sunnah, the only way is to combine adhkār, as Al–Nawawī said, and as Ibn Naṣr has related it in <em>Qiyām al–Layl</em> (76) from Ibn Jurayj as done by ʿAtāʾ, or to repeat one of the adhkār for which there is text for repetition, and this is closer to the Sunnah.

<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">NB</span>: This ḥadīth does not prove that those following an imām should not share with the imām in saying: “Allāh listens to the one who praises Him,” just as it does not prove that the imām does not share with those following him in saying: “Our Lord, to You be all Praise.” This is because the purpose of this ḥadīth is not to set out exactly what the imām and his followers should say in this position; rather, it explains that the followers’ <em>tahmīd</em> should be said after the imām’s <em>tasmīʿ</em>. This is supported by the fact that the Prophet used to say the <em>tahmīd</em> when he was the imām, and also because the generality of his saying, “Pray as you have seen me praying,” dictates that the follower should say what the imām says, e.g. <em>tasmīʿ</em>, etc. Those respected brothers who referred to us in this issue should consider this, and perhaps what we have mentioned is satisfactory. Whoever would like further discussion on this issue should refer to the article by al–Ḥāfiẓ Ṣuyūtī on this matter in his book <em>al–Hāwī li al–Fatāwī</em> (1/529).<a href="#fnref41">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn56"><p>Al–Bukhārī and Muslim (first sentence only), Dārimī, Ḥākim, al–Shāfiʿī and Aḥmad. By “bones” here is meant those of the spinal structure, the vertebrae, as has preceded in the main text.</p>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">NB</span>: The meaning of this ḥadīth is clear and obvious: to be at ease in this standing. As for the usage of this ḥadīth by our brothers from the Hijāz and elsewhere as evidence to justify placing the right hand on the left in this standing, it is far-removed from the meaning of the multitude of narrations of this ḥadīth. In fact it is a false argument, since the placing mentioned is not referred to with regard to the first standing in any of the narrations or wordings of the ḥadīth; therefore, how can “the bones taking their proper places” mentioned in the ḥadīth be interpreted as referring to the right hand taking hold of the left before rukūʿ?! This would apply if all the versions of the ḥadīth could be construed to mean this, so what about when they imply an obviously different meaning? In fact, this placing of theirs cannot be inferred from the ḥadīth at all, since what is meant by “bones” is the bones of the spine, as confirmed by the Sunnah, “…he would stand straight until every vertebra returned to its place.”</p>
<p>I, for one, am in no doubt that to place the hands on the chest in this standing is an innovation and a leading astray, for it is not mentioned in any of the aḥādīth about prayer, despite their large number. Had this practice any foundation, it would have reached us by at least one narration. Further, not one of the Salaf practised it, nor has a single leading scholar of ḥadīth mentioned it, as far as I know.</p>
<p>This is not inconsistent with what Shaykh Tuwayjirī has quoted in his article (pp. 18-19) from Imām Aḥmad, “if one wishes, he may leave his hands by his sides, or, if he wishes, he can place them on his chest,” for Imām Aḥmad did not attribute this to the Prophet , but said it from his own ijtihād and opinion, and opinion can be erroneous. When authentic evidence establishes the innovatory nature of any practice, such as this one, then the saying of an imām in its favour does not negate its being an innovation, as Shaykh al–Islām Ibn Taymiyyah has written. In fact, I see in these words of his, an indication that Imām Aḥmad did not regard the above-mentioned placing as being proved in the Sunnah, for he allowed a choice between practising it and leaving it! – Does the respected shaykh think that the Imām also allowed a similar choice regarding placing the hands before rukūʿ? Thus, it is proved that the placing of the hands on the chest in the standing after rukūʿ is not part of the Sunnah. This is a brief discussion of this issue, which could be dealt with in more detail and depth, but due to lack of space here, that is done instead in my <em>Refutation against Shaykh Tuwayjirī</em>.<a href="#fnref56">↩</a></p></li>
