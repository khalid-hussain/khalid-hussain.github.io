<h2 id="important-notes-about-alṣalāh-ʿalā-alnabī-sending-prayers-on-the-prophet-of-the-ummah"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Important Notes about al–Ṣalāh ʿalā al–Nabī — Sending Prayers on the Prophet of the Ummah</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It can be seen that in most of these ways of sending prayers on the Prophet , there is no mention of Ibrāhīm separate from his family, the wording being, “…as you have sent prayers on the family of Ibrāhīm.” The reason for this is that in Arabic, the family of a man includes the man as well as his dependants, e.g. in the words of the Exalted, “Allāh has chosen Ādam, Nūḥ, the family of Ibrāhīm and the family of ʿImrān above all people. (Sūrah Āl ʿImrān, 3:33).”</p>
<p>“We sent against them a violent tornado with showers of stones, except the family of Lūṭ – We delivered them by early dawn (Sūrah al–Qamar 54:34);” similar is his saying , “O Allāh! send prayers on the family of Abū Awfā.” The phrase Ahl al–Bayt (people of the house) is also like this, e.g. “Allāh’s grace and His blessings be on you, O people of the house (Sūrah Hūd, 11:73).” Hence, Ibrāhīm is included in “the family of Ibrāhīm.”</p>
<p>Shaykh al–Islām Ibn Taymiyyah says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the versions have, “as you sent prayers on the family of Ibrāhīm” and “as you sent blessings on the family of Ibrāhīm;” some have ‘Ibrāhīm’ himself. This is because he is the cause of all prayers and purifications on them; the rest of his family are secondary recipients of all that. To show these two points, both wordings have been employed separately.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, there is a well-known question among the people of knowledge about the nature of the comparison in his statement, “as you sent prayers on…,” for it is true that the model for comparison is normally superior to the one being compared; here, the opposite is the case, since Muḥammad is greater than Ibrāhīm, and so his superiority dictates that the prayers requested are more excellent than any prayers received or to be received by anyone else. The people of knowledge have provided many answers to this, and these can be found in <em>Fatḥ al–Bārī</em> and <em>Jalāʾ al–Ifhām</em>. They amount to about ten views, all of which are unsubstantiated, some weaker than others, except one, a well-supported view, and adopted by Shaykh al–Islām Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al–Qayyim. This view is: “The family of Ibrāhīm includes many prophets; none like them is found in the family of Muḥammad. Therefore, when prayers on the Prophet and his family are sought similar to that bestowed on Ibrāhīm and his family, which includes prophets, the family of Muḥammad receives out of that what is appropriate for them. Since the family of Muḥammad does not reach the rank of the prophets, the extra blessings and benefit given to the prophets, including Ibrāhīm, are left for Muḥammad . Thus he gains a distinguished position which others cannot reach.”</p>
<p>Ibn al–Qayyim says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the best of all the previous views: that Muḥammad is one of the family of Ibrāhīm; in fact, he is the best of the family of Ibrāhīm, as ʿAlī ibn Ṭalḥah has related from Ibn ʿAbbās about the saying of the Exalted, “Allāh has chosen Ādam, Nūḥ, the family of Ibrāhīm and the family of ʿImrān above all people (Āl ʿImrān, 3:33);” Ibn ʿAbbās said, “Muḥammad is among the family of Ibrāhīm”. This is text for the fact that if other prophets descended from Ibrāhīm are included in his family, then the inclusion of the Messenger of Allāh is more fitting. Hence our saying, “…as you sent prayers on the family of Ibrāhīm,” includes the prayers sent on him and on the rest of the prophets descended from Ibrāhīm. Allāh has then ordered us to specifically send prayers on Muḥammad and his family, as much as we send prayers on him, along with the rest of Ibrāhīm’s family generally. Therefore, the Prophet’s family receives out of that what is appropriate for them, leaving all of the remainder to him . There is no doubt that the total amount of prayers received by Ibrāhīm’s family, with the Messenger of Allāh among them, is greater than that received by the Prophet alone. Therefore, what is sought for him is such a great favour, definitely superior than that sought for Ibrāhīm. Hence, the nature of the comparison and its consistency become clear. The prayers sought for him with these words are greater than those requested any other way, since what is requested with the supplication is that it be as much as the model of comparison, and that the Prophet receive a large portion: the comparison dictates that what is requested is more than what was given to Ibrāhīm and others. Thus, the excellence and nobility of Muḥammad , over and above Ibrāhīm and his family, which includes many prophets, is evident, and is as he deserves. This sending of prayers on the Prophet becomes evidence for this excellence of his, and this is no more than he deserves. So, may Allāh send prayers on him and on his family, and send peace on them, many greetings of peace, and reward him from our supplications better than He has rewarded any prophet from his people. O Allāh! send prayers on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad, as you sent prayers on the family of Ibrāhīm; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory. And send blessings on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad, as you sent blessings on the family of Ibrāhīm; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory.&quot;</p>

<li><p>The reader will see that this part of the Prayer, with all its different types, is always a sending of prayers on the family of the Prophet : on his wives and children as well as himself. Therefore, it is neither from the Sunnah, nor carrying out the Prophet’s command, to leave it at “O Allāh! send prayers on Muḥammad” only. Rather, one of these complete types of supplication must be used, as is reported from his action , whether in the first or the last tashahhud. There is text about this from Imām al–Shāfiʿī in <em>al–Umm</em>: “The tashahhud in the first and second instance is the same thing; by ‘tashahhud’, I mean the bearing of witness and the sending of prayers on the Prophet : neither will suffice without the other.”</p>
<p>In fact, one of the most amazing things to arise from this age and its intellectual anarchy is that one person, Muḥammad Isʿāf al–Nashāshībī, in his book <em>al–Islām al–Ṣaḥīḥ</em> (“The Correct Islām”), has the audacity to reject the sending of prayers on the family of the Prophet when sending prayers on him, despite it being firmly established in the Ṣaḥīḥs of al–Bukhārī and Muslim, and elsewhere, on the authority of several Companions, e.g. Kaʿb ibn ʿUjrah, Abū Humayd al–Sāʿīdī, Abū Saʿīd al–Khudrī, Abū Masʿūd al–Anṣārī, Abū Hurayrah and Ṭalḥah ibn ʿUbayd Allāh! In their aḥādīth, it is found that they asked the Prophet , “How do we send prayers on you?” so he taught them this way of doing so. Al–Nashāshībī’s’ argument for his view is that Allāh the Exalted did not mention anyone else with the Prophet in His saying: “O you who believe! Send prayers on him, and salute him with all respect. (Sūrah Aḥzāb, 33:56)” He then goes on to say in his refutation that the Companions asked him that question because the meaning of “ṣalāh” was known to them as “supplication,” so they were asking: “How can we supplicate to you?”!</p>
<p>This is a clear deception, for their question was not about the meaning of “ṣalāh” on him, in which case he would have a point, but it was about the manner of doing the ṣalāh on him, as is found in the narrations to which we have referred. Thus it all fits, for they asked him about the way of doing it according to the Sharīʿah, something which they could not possibly find out except from the guidance of the All-Knowing, All-Wise, Giver of the ṣalāh. Similarly, they could also ask him about the way of performing the Ṣalāh made obligatory by words of the Exalted such as “Establish the Ṣalāh (Prayer);” for their knowledge of the literal meaning of “Ṣalāh” could not remove their need to ask about its manner according to the Sharīʿah, and this is crystal clear.</p>
<p>As for al–Nashāshībī’s argument referred to, it is of no consequence, for it is well-known among the Muslims that the Prophet is the expounder of the words of the Lord of the Worlds, as He says:</p>
<p>“And We have sent down to you the Message that you may explain clearly to the people what is sent for them (Sūrah al–Nahl, 16:44).”</p>
<p>Hence, the Prophet explained the way of doing ṣalāh on him, and it included mention of his family, so it is compulsory to accept that from him, due to Allāh’s saying:</p>
<p>“So take what the Messenger gives you (Hashr 59:7),” and the well-known authentic ḥadīth, “Verily, I have been given the Qurʾān and something similar to it.”<a href="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>I really wonder what al–Nashāshībī and those taken in by his pompous words would say if someone were to reject the tashahhud in prayer altogether, or reject the menstruating woman’s abstaining from prayer and fasting, all with the argument that Allāh the Exalted did not mention the tashahhud in the Qurʾān; He only mentioned bowing and prostration, and He did not exempt a menstruating woman from prayer and fasting in the Qurʾān! So, do they agree with such arguments, which are along the lines of his original one, or not? If they do, and we hope not, then they have strayed far, far away from guidance, and have left the mainstream of the Muslims; if they do not, then they are correct in agreeing with us, and their reasons for rejecting those arguments are exactly the same as our reasons for rejecting al–Nashāshībī’s original pronouncement, which we have explained clearly.</p>
<p>Therefore beware, O Muslims, of attempting to understand the Qurʾān without recourse to the Sunnah, for you will never be able to do that, even if you were the Sībawayh<a href="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> of the age; the expert of the age in the Arabic language. Here is an example in front of you, for this al–Nashāshībī is one of the leading scholars of the Arabic language of this period; you have seen how he has strayed, after being deceived by his knowledge of the language, by not seeking the aid of the Sunnah in understanding the Qurʾān; in fact he has rejected this aid, as you know. There are many other examples of this – there is not enough room here to mention them, but what we have mentioned will suffice, and Allāh is the Granter of all capability.</p></li>
<li><p>The reader will also see that in none of these types of ṣalāh on the Prophet is there the word sayyid (chief, leader). The later scholars have differed about the validity of its inclusion in the Ibrāhīmī ṣalāh. Due to lack of space we will not go into the details of that nor make mention of those who rejected its validity in keeping with the Prophet’s complete teaching to his ummah when he instructed, “Say: O Allāh! send prayers on Muḥammad…” on being asked about the manner of ṣalāh on him, but we will quote al–Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr al–ʿAsqalānī on this, bearing in mind his position as one of the great Shāfiʿī scholars of both ḥadīth and fiqh, for contradiction of this teaching of the Prophet has become widespread among Shāfiʿī scholars!</p>
<p>Al–Ḥāfiẓ Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al–Ghurābīlī (790–835 <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">AH</span>), a companion of Ibn Ḥajr, said, and I quote from his manuscript<a href="#fn53" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He (i.e. Ibn Ḥajr), may Allāh benefit us with his life, was asked about the features of ṣalāh on the Prophet , whether during prayer or outside it, compulsory or recommended: Is one of its conditions that the Prophet be attributed with sayādah (leadership), e.g. “O Allāh! send prayers on sayyidinā (our leader) Muḥammad…” or “the foremost of creation,” or “the leader of the children of Ādam” etc.? or should one stick to “O Allāh! send prayers on Muḥammad”? Which of these two is the better approach: including the word sayyid, due to it being an established attribute of the Prophet , or leaving it out due to the absence of it in the narrations? He (Ibn Ḥajr), may Allāh be pleased with him, replied: “Yes, to follow the narrated wording is superior. It cannot be said,”Maybe the Prophet himself did not say it out of modesty, just as he did not say on mention of his name, although his Ummah has been encouraged to do so&quot; – for we say that if that were superior, it would have been quoted from the Companions and then from the Successors, but we do not come across it in any narrations from any Companion or Successor. This is despite the volume of quotations from them. We have Imām al-Shāfiʿī, may Allāh exalt his rank, one of the foremost among men in his respect for the Prophet , saying in the preface to his book which is a base for the people of his madhhab: “O Allāh! send prayers on Muḥammad…” etc. until the end of what his judgment dictated, “…every time one of the rememberers remembers him, and every time one of the heedless fails to remember him,” which he seems to have deduced from the authentic hadeeth which has in it that the Prophet saw the Mother of the Believers engaging in long and numerous glorifications, so he said to her, “You have said words which, if weighed against the following, would be balanced: Glorified be Allāh, as many times as the number of His creation”; he used to like supplications which were concise, but exhaustive in meaning. Qāḍī ʿIyāّḍ set out a chapter about ṣalāh on the Prophet in his book <em>al–Shifāʾ</em> (The Book of Cure), noting in it narrations from the Prophet on the authority of several Companions and Successors; in none of these is the word “sayyid” reported:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol type="a">
<li>The ḥadīth of ʿAlī, that he used to teach them the manner of ṣalāh on the Prophet by saying, “O Allāh, Spreader of Plains, Originator of Heights, send the foremost of Your prayers, the most fertile of Your blessings, and any remaining compliments, on Muḥammad, Your slave and messenger, the opener of what is closed.”</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>Again from ʿAlī, that he used to say, “The prayers of Allāh, the Beneficent, the Merciful, of the Angels nearest (to Allāh), of the Prophets, of the Sincere ones, of the Witnesses, of the Righteous, and of whatever glorifies You, O Lord of the Worlds, be on Muḥammad son of ʿAbd Allāh, Seal of the Prophets, Imām of the Godfearers…etc.”</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>On the authority of ʿAbd Allāh ibn Masʿūd, that he used to say, “O Allāh! send Your prayers, Your blessings and Your mercy, on Muḥammad, Your slave and messenger, the imām of goodness, the messenger of mercy…” etc.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4" type="a">
<li>From al–Ḥasan al–Baṣrī, that he used to say, “Whoever wants to drink from the cup which quenches, from the fount of the al–Musṭafā, should say: ‘O Allāh! send prayers on Muḥammad, and on his family, his Companions, his wives, his children, his descendants, his household, his in-laws, his helpers, his followers, and all those who love him.’”</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what he (Qāḍī ʿIyāḍ) has written in al–Shifāʾ, regarding the manner of ṣalāh on the Prophet, on the authority of the Companions and those who succeeded them, and he also mentioned other things in it. Yes, it is related in a ḥadīth of Ibn Masʿūd that in his ṣalāh on the Prophet , he would say, “O Allāh! send the best of Your prayers, mercy and blessings on the leader (sayyid) of the messengers…” etc. transmitted by Ibn Mājah, but its isnād is weak, so the ḥadīth of ʿAlī, transmitted by al–Ṭabarānī with a acceptable isnād, takes precedence. This ḥadīth has difficult words, which I have reported and explained in the book <em>Faḍl al–Nabī</em> (Excellence of the Prophet ) by Abū al–Ḥasan ibn al–Fāris. Some Shāfiʿīs have said that if a man took an oath to send the best ṣalāh on the Prophet , the way to fulfil his oath would be to say, “O Allāh! send prayers on Muḥammad every time the rememberers remember him or the heedless fail to remember him;” Al–Nawawī said, “The one which is most fitting to be designated as correct is that one should say: ‘O Allāh! send prayers on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad, as you sent prayers on Ibrāhīm…’” Several of the later scholars have replied to this by saying that in neither of the two ways mentioned above is there anything to prove which is superior as regards narration, but as regards the meaning, then the former is clearly superior. This issue is well-known in the books of fiqh, and of all the scholars of fiqh who addressed this issue, without exception, in none of their words does the word “sayyid” appear. Had this additional word been commendable, it would not have escaped all of them, leaving them ignorant of it. All good is in following what is narrated, and Allāh knows best.</p>
<p>Ibn Ḥajr’s view of the unacceptability of describing the Prophet as sayyid during the ṣalāh on him in accordance with the Qurʾānic order, is also that of the Ḥanafī scholars. It is the view which must be adhered to, for it is a true indication of love for him ;</p>
<p>“Say: If you do love Allāh, then follow me. Allāh will love you. (Sūrah Āl ʿImrān, 3:31)”</p>
<p>Because of this, Imām al–Nawawī said in <em>Rawḍah al–Ṭālibīn</em> (1/265), “The most complete ṣalāh on the Prophet is: ‘O Allāh! send your prayers on Muḥammad…’” etc. corresponding to type no. 3 given, in which there is no mention of sayyid!</p></li>
<li><p>It should be known that types nos. 1 and 4 are the ones which the Messenger of Allāh taught his Companions when they asked about the manner of ṣalāh on him, so this has been used as evidence that these are the best ways of doing the ṣalāh on him, for he would not choose anything for them or himself except the best and noblest. Imām al–Nawawī, as mentioned, endorsed (in <em>Rawḍah al–Ṭālibīn</em>) that if a man were to take an oath to do the best possible ṣalāh on the Prophet , this could not be fulfilled except in these ways.</p>
<p>Al–Subkī has given another reason: “whoever does ṣalāh with those types has made ṣalāh on the Prophet with certainty, and whoever does so with other words is in doubt whether or not he has performed the prayers as requested. This is because they said, ‘How do we send prayers on you?’ and he replied, ‘Say: …,’ thus defining their ṣalāh on him as their saying such-and-such. This was mentioned by Haytamī in <em>al–Darr al-Mandūd</em> (25/2); he then said (27/1) that the objective is achieved with all the types which have occurred in authentic aḥādīth.</p></li>
<li><p>It should be known that it is not valid to combine all these way into one way of ṣalāh, and the same goes for the different tashahhuds given previously. In fact, that would be an innovation in the religion; the Sunnah is to say different ones at different times, as Shaykh al–Islām Ibn Taymiyyah has explained in his discussion of the takbīrs of the two ʿEids (<em>Majmūʿ al–Fatāwā</em>, 29/253/1).</p></li>
<li><p>ʿAllāmah Siddīq Ḥasan Khān says in his book <em>Nuzūl al–Abrār bi al–ʿIlm al–Maّʾthūr min al–Adʿiyah wa al–Adhkār</em>, after giving many aḥādīth about the excellence of repeated ṣalāh on the Prophet (p. 161):</p>
<p>“There is no doubt that the foremost among the Muslims in sending ṣalāh on him are the People of Ḥadīth and the narrators of the purified Sunnah, for it is one of their duties in this noble branch of learning to make ṣalāh on him before every ḥadīth, and so their tongues are always engaged in his mention, may Allah grant him mercy and peace. There is no book of Sunnah or collection of ḥadīth, be it a jāmiʿ, musnad, muʿjam, juzʾ, etc. except that it comprises thousands of aḥādīth; even one of the least bulky ones, al–Suyūṭī’s <em>al–Jāmiʿ al–Ṣaghīr</em>, contains ten thousand aḥādīth, and the rest of the collections are no different. So this is the Saved Sect: the body of the People of Ḥadīth, who will be the closest among men to the Messenger of Allāh on the Day of Resurrection, and the most likely to be rewarded by his intercession , may my mother and father be sacrificed for him! This excellence of the People of Ḥadīth cannot be surpassed by anyone unless he does more than what they do, something which is well-nigh impossible. Therefore, O desirer of good, seeker of salvation, no matter what, you should either be a muḥaddith, or be close to the muḥaddithīn; do not be otherwise…for apart from that there is nothing which will benefit you.”</p>
<p>I ask Allāh, Blessed and Exalted, to make me one of these People of Ḥadīth, who are the closest among men to the Messenger of Allāh ; perhaps this book will be a testimony to that. May Allāh shower His mercy on Imām Aḥmad, who recited:</p>
<div style="white-space: pre-line;">The religion of Muḥammad is in narrations,

<p>He also set the guidance of duʿāʾ in this tashahhud as well, saying, “When you sit after every two rakʿahs, then say: ‘All compliments are due to Allāh…’ (till the end of that supplication, and then said:) …then he should select of the supplications what is most pleasing to him.”<a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p>He would recite al–Fātiḥah in both these rakʿahs, and he ordered “the one who prayed badly” to do that. In Ẓuhr prayer, he would sometimes add a few āyāt to this, as has been explained under “Recitation in Ẓuhr Prayer.”</p>

This is the view of Mālik and others. Imām Aḥmad was asked, “Should a man point with his finger during prayer?” He replied, “Yes, vigorously.” (Mentioned by Ibn Hānī in his <em>Masāʾil of Imām Aḥmad</em>, 1/80). From this, it is clear that moving the finger in tashahhud is a proven sunnah of the Prophet , and it was practised by Aḥmad and other imāms of the Sunnah. Therefore, those who think that it is pointless and irrelevant and has nothing to do with the Prayer, should fear Allāh, since because of this, they do not move their fingers although they know it to be an established sunnah; and they take great pains to interpret it in a way which is inconsistent with the Arabic way of expression and contrary to the understanding of the imāms with regard to it.</p>
<p>The amazing thing is that some of them will defend an imām on other issues, even if his opinion conflicts with the Sunnah, with the argument that to point out the imām’s mistakes inevitably means to taunt and disrespect him. They then forget this and reject this established sunnah, at the same time mocking at those who practise it. Whether or not they realise it, their mockery also includes those imāms whom they often defend wrongly, and who are correct about the Sunnah this time! In fact, they are deriding the Prophet himself, for he is the one who brought us this sunnah, and so jeering at it is equivalent to jeering at him. andlt;andlt; “But what is the reward for those among you who behave like this except…”</p>
<p>As for putting the finger down after pointing, or limiting the movement to the affirmation (saying <em>lā ilāha</em>: “there is no god…”) and negation (saying: <em>illallāhu</em>: “…except Allāh”), all of that has no basis in the Sunnah; in fact, it is contrary to the Sunnah, as this ḥadīth proves.</p>
<p>Further, the ḥadīth that he would not move his finger does not have an authentic isnād, as I have explained in <em>Ḍaʿīf Abī Dāwūd</em> (175). Even if it were authentic, it is negatory, while the ḥadīth above is affirmatory: the affirmatory takes precedence over the negatory, as is well-known among the scholars.<a href="#fnref14">↩</a></p></li>

<p>Ibn Masūd’s statement, “We said: Peace be on the Prophet” clarifies that the Companions used to say, “Peace be on you, O Prophet” in tashahhud while the Prophet was alive, but when he died, they ceased to do that, instead saying, “Peace be on the Prophet.” Undoubtedly, this was with the endorsement of the Prophet ; this is supported by the fact that ʿĀʾishah would similarly teach the tashahhud in prayer with “Peace be on the Prophet,” as transmitted by Sirāj in his <em>Musnad</em> (9/1/2) and Mukhlis in <em>al–Fawāʾiḍ</em> (11/54/1) with two ṣaḥīḥ isnāds from her.</p>
<p>Ibn Ḥajar says, “This addition shows clearly that they used to say ‘Peace be on you, O Prophet,’ addressing him directly during his life, but when the Prophet died, they stopped addressing him and mentioned him in the third person instead, saying ‘Peace be on the Prophet.’” He also says in a different place, “Subkī said in <em>Sharḥ al–Minhāj</em>, after mentioning this narration from Abū ʿAwānah only, ‘If this is authentically-reported from the Companions, it proves that after his time, it is not compulsory to address the Prophet directly in the greeting of peace, so one says: “Peace be on the Prophet.”’” Ibn Ḥajar continues: “This is authentic without doubt (i.e. because it is established in Ṣaḥīḥ al–Bukhārī), and I have also found strong support for it: ʿAbd al–Razzāq said: Ibn Jurayj informed me: ʿAtā informed me that the Companions used to say ‘Peace be on you, O Prophet’ while the Prophet was alive, but after he died, they would say ‘Peace be on the Prophet,’ and this is a ṣaḥīḥ isnād. As for Saʿīd bin Manṣūr’s narration from Abū ʿUbaydah bin ʿAbd Allāh bin Masʿūd, who reported from his father that the Prophet taught them the tashahhud, and then he (ʿAbd Allāh bin Masʿūd) said it (the tashahhud); Ibn ʿAbbās said: We used to say ‘Peace be on you, O Prophet’ only while he was alive, to which Ibn Masʿūd replied, ‘This is how we were taught, and this is how we teach it,’ it would appear that Ibn ʿAbbās said this as a matter of discussion but Ibn Masʿūd did not accept. However, the narration of Abū Maʿmar (i.e. the narration of al–Bukhārī) is more authentic, since Abū ʿUbaydah did not hear (aḥādīth) from his father, and furthermore, the isnād up to Abū ʿUbaydah is weak.” (End of quote from Ibn Ḥajar)</p>
<p>These words of Ibn Ḥajar have been quoted by several scholars in their analysis, e.g. Qastalānū, Zarqānī, al–Lucknowī, etc. They all chose to give his words without commenting further. This discussion is treated more fully in <em>al–Aṣl</em>.<a href="#fnref31">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn34"><p>These two additions have been proved to be part of the tashahhud from the Prophet . Ibn ʿUmar did not add them of his own accord (far is he above such a thing!); in fact, he learnt them from other Companions who reported them from the Prophet , and he then added them to the tashahhud which he heard from the Prophet directly.<a href="#fnref34">↩</a></p></li>

<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">NB</span>: In none of the types of tashahhud is there the addition: <em>wa maghfiratuhu</em> (…“and His forgiveness”), so one should not be accustomed to it. Hence some of the Salaf rebuked it, as the following narrations show:</p>
<p>Al–Ṭabarānī (3/56/1) reported with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād from Ṭalḥah bin Musarrif, who said: Rabīʿ bin Khaytham added during tashahhud, “…and His blessings, and His forgiveness”! So ʿAlqamah said, “We stop where we were taught: ‘Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and also the mercy of Allāh and His blessings;’” ʿAlqamah was actually following the example of his teacher ʿAbd Allāh bin Masʿūd, from whom it is authentically-reported that he was teaching a man the tashahhud: when he got to “I bear witness that there is no (true) god except Allāh…,” the man said: “alone, He has no partner,” to which ʿAbd Allāh said, “He is so, but we stop at where we were taught.” (Transmitted by al–Ṭabarānī in <em>Muʿjam al–Awsaṭ</em>, no. 2848, with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād.)<a href="#fnref37">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn38"><p>Abū ʿAwānah in his ṣaḥīḥ (2/324) and al–Nasāʾī.<a href="#fnref38">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn39"><p>They had said, “O Messenger of Allāh, we have been taught how to send peace on you (i.e. in tashahhud), but how do we send prayers on you?” He said, “Say: O Allāh! send prayers on Muḥammad…” etc. Thus he did not specify one tashahhud to the exclusion of another, so there is evidence here to establish sending prayers on him in the first tashahhud also. This is the way of Imām al–Shāfiʿī, as in the text of his book <em>al–Umm</em>, and it is held to be correct by his companions, as al–Nawawī has explained in <em>al–Majmūʿ</em> (3/460) and supported in <em>Rawḍah Ṭālibīn</em> (1/263). It is also the view of Wazīr bin Hubayrah al–Ḥanbalī in <em>al–Ifsāh</em>, as Ibn Rajab ha quoted and strongly supported in <em>Dhayl Ṭabaqāt</em> (1/280). Many aḥādīth exist about sending prayers on him in tashahhud; in none of them is there any such specification mentioned. In fact, these aḥādīth are general, hence including every tashahhud, and I have given them in <em>al–Aṣl</em> as taʿleeq, but not in the main text, for they do not satisfy our conditions for authenticity. However, they do support each other in meaning, and those who reject and oppose this have no authentic evidence to use as proof, as I have detailed in <em>al–Aṣl</em>. Similarly, to say that adding anything to “O Allāh! send prayers on Muḥammad” is makrūh has no basis in the Sunnah, nor is there any convincing proof for it. In fact, we see that whoever says this does not implement the previous instruction of the Prophet , “Say: O Allāh! send prayers on Muḥammad, and on the family of Muḥammad…;” there is more to this discussion in <em>al–Aṣl</em>.<a href="#fnref39">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn40"><p>One of the earliest views about the meaning of “sending prayers on the Prophet ” is that of Abū al–ʿAaliyah (with reference to Sūrah al–Aḥzāb, 33:56), “Allāh’s sending prayers on his Prophet means His exalting him and raising his rank; the angels and others sending prayers means their seeking this from Allāh, and here it is meant asking the prayers to be increased, not asking for the original prayer in itself.” Ibn Ḥajar quoted this in <em>Fatḥ al–Bārī</em>, and went on to refute the widespread notion that the Lord’s prayer on someone is His Mercy; Ibn al–Qayyim also clarified this in <em>Jalāʾ al–Afhām</em>, leaving little scope for further comment.<a href="#fnref40">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn41"><p>from <em>barakah</em>: growth, increase. Hence this supplication secures for Muḥammad the good which Allāh granted to the family of Ibrāhīm, continual, established good, as well as its multiplying and increase.<a href="#fnref41">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn44"><p>These two additions are conclusively found in al–Bukhārī, al–Ṭaḥāwī, Bayhaqī, Aḥmad and al–Nasāʾī. They also exist via different routes of narration in other types of this supplication (see nos. 3 and 7), and so do not be confused by Ibn al–Qayyim’s view in <em>Jalāʾ al–Afhām</em> (p. 198), following in the footsteps of his great teacher Ibn Taymiyyah in <em>al–Fatāwā</em> (1/16), “There is no authentic ḥadīth with the phrases ‘Ibrāhīm’ and ‘the family of Ibrāhīm’ together;” here, we have shown you such authentic aḥādīth.

As for wiping the face with the hands, it is not reported in this position, and is thus an innovation; as for outside of prayer, it is not authentically-reported: all that has been transmitted in this regard is either weak or very weak, as I have shown in <em>Ḍaʿīf Abī Dāwūd</em> (262) and <em>Silsilah al–Aḥādīth al–Ṣaḥīḥah</em> (597).

<li id="fn72"><p>We have said, “…sometimes” because the Companions who narrated the Witr prayer did not mention the qunūt in it, whereas had the Prophet done so always, they would have all mentioned it. However, Ubayy ibn Kaʿb alone narrated the qunūt in Witr, so this shows that he used to do it sometimes. Hence, this is evidence that qunūt in Witr is not obligatory (wājib), and this is the opinion of the majority of scholars. For this reason, the researching Ḥanafī scholar, Ibn al–Humām, recognised in <em>Fatḥ al–Qadīr</em> (1/306, 359, 360) that the view of it being obligatory is feeble and not substantiated by evidence. This shows his fairness and lack of party-spirit, for this view which he has supported is contrary to his madhhab!<a href="#fnref72">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn73"><p>Ibn Abī Shaybah (12/41/1), Abū Dāwūd, al–Nasāʾī in <em>Sunan al–Kubrāʾ</em> (218/1-2), Aḥmad, al–Ṭabarānī, Bayhaqī and Ibn ʿAsākir (4/244/2) narrated this, along with the supplication after it, with a ṣaḥīḥ sanad. Ibn Mandah narrated the supplication only in <em>Tawḥīd</em> (70/2) with a different, ḥasan sanad. Its takhrīj is also given in <em>Irwāʾ al–Ghalīl</em> (426).<a href="#fnref73">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn74"><p>Ibn Khuzaymah (1/119/2) and also Ibn Abī Shaybah etc., as for the last ḥadīth.</p>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">NB</span>: Al–Nasāʾī adds at the end of the qunūt: <em>wa sall-Allāhu ʿalā al–Nabīyy al–Ummīyy</em> (“may Allāh send prayers on the Unlettered Prophet”), related with a weak isnād; among those who declared it ḍaʿīf are Ibn Ḥajar al-ʿAsqalānī and Zurqānī. Therefore, we have not included it in our system of combining acceptable narrations. ʿIzz bin ʿAbd al–Salām said in <em>al–Fatāwā</em> (66/1, 1962), “To send prayers on the Messenger of Allāh in qunūt is not authentic, nor is it fitting to add to the Messenger of Allāh’s prayer in any way.” This view of his shows that he did not widen the argument by including the idea of bidʿah ḥasanah (“good” innovation), as some of the later scholars are prone to doing!</p>
<p>However, it is proved in the ḥadīth about ʿUbayy bin Kaʿb leading the people during the Ramaḍān night prayers that he used to send prayers on the Prophet at the end of the qunūt, and that was during the reign of ʿUmar – transmitted by Ibn Khuzaymah in his <em>Ṣaḥīḥ</em> (1097). Similarly is proved from Abū Halīmah Muʿādh al–Anṣārī, who also used to lead them during ʿUmar’s rule – transmitted by Ismāʿīl al–Qāḍī (no. 107) and others, so this addition is justified by the practice of the Salaf, and it is thus not fitting to categorically state that this addition is an innovation. Allāh knows best.<a href="#fnref74">↩</a></p></li>
