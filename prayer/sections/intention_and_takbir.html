<h1 id="intention-and-takbīr"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Intention and Takbīr</h1>
<p>He used to say: “All actions are by intention,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and every man shall have what he intended.”<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<hr />
<p>Then he would commence the prayer by saying:</p>
<!-- TODO fix this -->
<!-- ![](/images/salah/101.gif)   -->
<p>“Allāh is the Greatest”<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>He ordered “the man who prayed badly” to do likewise as has been mentioned, and he said to him: “Verily, the prayer of a person is not complete until he has made an ablution which has included the necessary parts of the body and has then said: ‘Allāhu Akbar.’”<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>He would also used to say: “The key to the prayer is purification, it is entered by takbīr and exited by taslīm.”<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Also, “he used to raise his voice for the takbīr such that those behind him could hear.”<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> But, “when he fell ill Abū Bakr used to raise his voice to convey the takbīr of the Messenger to the people.”<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>He would also say: “When the Imām says: Allāhu Akbar, then say, ‘Allāhu Akbar.’”<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="raising-the-hands"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Raising the Hands</h2>
<p>He would raise his hands sometimes with the takbīr,<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> sometimes after the takbīr,<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and sometimes before it.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>“He would raise them with fingers apart [not spaced out, nor together],”<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and “he would put them level with his shoulders,”<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> although occasionally, “he would raise them until they were level with [the tops of] his ears.”<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="to-place-the-right-arm-on-the-left-arm-and-the-command-for-it"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> To Place The Right Arm On The Left Arm, And The Command For It</h2>
<p>“He used to place his right arm on his left arm,”<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and he used to say: “We, the company of prophets, have been commanded to hasten the breaking of the fast, to delay the meal before the fast, and to place our right arms on our left arms during prayer.”<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Also “he passed by a man who was praying and had placed his left arm on his right, so he pulled them apart and placed the right on the left.”<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="to-place-the-hands-on-the-chest"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> To Place the Hands on the Chest</h2>
<p>“He used to place the right arm on the back of his left palm, wrist and forearm,”<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> “and he commanded his companions to do likewise,”<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and (sometimes) “he would grasp his left arm with his right.”<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>“He used to place them on his chest.”<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Also “he used to forbid putting one’s hand on the waist during prayer [and he put his hand on his waist (to demonstrate)].”<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> And this is the “silb” (cross) which he used to forbid.<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Literally, “the takbeer makes it ḥarām,” i.e. the actions which Allāh has made ḥarām during it, “and the taslīm makes it ḥalāl,” i.e. what is allowed outside prayer. Just as the ḥadīth proves that the door to prayer is shut, no worshipper being able to open it except with purification, it similarly proves that the prayer cannot be entered except with takbīr, and that it cannot be exited except with taslīm. This is the view of the majority of scholars.</p>

<h2 id="to-look-at-the-place-of-prostration-and-humility"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> To Look at the Place of Prostration, and Humility</h2>
<p>“He used to incline his head during prayer and fix his sight towards the ground”<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> – “while he was in the Kaʿbah, his sight did not leave the place of his prostration until he came out from it”;<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and he said, “It is not fitting that there should be anything in the house which disturbs the person praying.”<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>“He used to forbid looking up at the sky,”<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> and he emphasised this prohibition so much that he said: “People must refrain from looking up at the sky in prayer, or their sight will not return to them (and in one narration: or their sight will be plucked away).”<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In another ḥadīth: “So when you pray, do not look here and there, for Allāh sets His Face for the face of his slave in his prayer as long as he does not look away,”<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and he also said about looking here and there, “it is a snatching away which the devil steals from the slave during prayer.”<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<!-- TODO  iq'aa' -->
<p>He also said: “Allāh does not cease to turn to a slave in his prayer as long as he is not looking around; when he turns his face away, Allāh turns away from him<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a>;” he “forbade three things: pecking like a hen, squatting (iq’aa’), like a dog and looking around like a fox<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a>;” he also used to say, “Pray a farewell prayer as if you see Him, but if you do not see Him, surely He sees you;”<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and, “Any person who, when an obligatory prayer is due, excels in its ablution, humility and bowings, will have it as a remission for his previous minor sins as long as he does not commit a major sin, and this (opportunity) is for all times.”<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<!-- TODO double check the following -->
<p>Once he , prayed in a khamīsah<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> and (during the prayer) he looked at its marks. So when he finished, he said: “Take this khamīsah of mine to Abū Jahm and bring me his anbijāniyyah,<a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> for it has diverted my attention from the prayer (in one narration: for I have looked at its marks during the prayer and it almost put me to trial).”<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Also “ʿĀʾishah had a cloth with pictures spread towards a sahwah,<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> towards which the Prophet prayed and then said:”Take it away from me [for its pictures did not cease to thwart me in my prayer].<a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>He would also say: “Prayer is not valid when the food has been served, nor when it is time to relieve oneself of the two filths.”<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn1"><p>al–Nawawī says in <em>Rawdah at-Taalibeen</em> (1/224 Maktab al–Islāmī edition):</p>
<p>“The intention is the purpose, so the person about to pray brings to mind that prayer and what is relevant of its characteristics, such as which prayer it is, whether it is obligatory etc. and he brings these things together in his intention with the first takbīr.”<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn3"><p>Muslim and Ibn Mājah. The ḥadīth contains an indication that he did not use to commence it with the words of some people: “I intend to pray, etc.” which is in fact agreed to be an innovation. But they differ as to whether it is a good or bad innovation, to which we say: “Indeed all innovations in worship are misguided, from the generality of his statement ,”and all innovations are misleading, and every misleading thing is in the Fire.&quot; But this is not the place for a detailed discussion of this.<a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn20"><p>al–Nasāʾī and al–Dāraquṭnī with a ṣaḥīḥ isnād. In this ḥadīth there is evidence that grasping is from the sunnah, and in the previous ḥadīth that so is placing, so both are sunnah. As for the combination of holding and placing, which some of the later Ḥanafīs hold to be good, then that is an innovation; its form as they state is to place the right hand on the left, holding the wrist with the little finger and the thumb, and laying flat the remaining three fingers, as described in Ibn ʿĀbidīn’s footnotes on <em>Durr al–Mukhtaar</em> (1/454); so do not be confused by what they say.<a href="#fnref20">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn21"><p>Abū Dāwūd, Ibn Khuzaymah in his ṣaḥīḥ (1/54/2), Aḥmad and Abū Shaykh in <em>Tārīkh Isbahaan</em> (p. 125); al–Tirmidhī declared one of its isnāds ḥasan, and its meaning is found in <em>al-Muwaṭṭāʾ</em> and <em>Ṣaḥīḥ al–Bukhārī</em> if considered carefully. I have fully quoted the isnāds of this ḥadīth in my book <em>Aḥkām al–Janāʾiz</em> (p. 118).</p>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">NOTE:</span> To place them on the chest is what is proved in the Sunnah, and all that is contrary to it is either ḍaʿīf or totally baseless. In fact, Imām Isḥāq ibn Rāhawayh acted on this sunnah, as Marwazī said in <em>Masāʾil</em> (p. 222): “Isḥāq used to pray witr with us and he would raise his hands in qunūt, and make the qunūt before bowing, and place his hands on his breast or just under his breast.” Similar is the saying of Qāḍī ʿIyāḍ al–Mālikī in <em>Mustahabbāt al–Ṣalāh</em> in his book <em>al–Iʿlām</em> (p. 15, 3rd edition, Rabat): “the right arm is to be placed on the back of the left, on the upper part of the chest.” Close to this is what ʿAbd Allah ibn Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal related in his <em>Masāʾil</em> (p. 62): “I saw that when praying, my father placed his hands, one on the other, above the navel.” See Appendix 4.<a href="#fnref21">↩</a></p></li>

<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">NB:</span> These two aḥādīth show that the sunnah is to fix one’s sight on the place of prostration on the ground, so the action of some worshippers of closing their eyes during Prayer is misdirected piety, for the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad .<a href="#fnref24">↩</a></p></li>

The Messenger did not order the wiping out or tearing of the pictures but only removed them because – and Allaah knows best – they were not pictures of things having souls. The evidence for this is that he tore other pictures as proved by many narrations in al–Bukhārī and Muslim, and whoever wishes to explore this further should consult <em>Fatḥ al–Bārī</em> (10/321) and <em>Ghāyah al–Marām fī Takhrīj Aḥādīth al–Ḥalāl wa al–Ḥarām</em> (nos. 131-145).<a href="#fnref39">↩</a></p></li>
