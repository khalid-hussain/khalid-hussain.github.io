## Introduction

'The Tufte Jekyll theme' is an attempt to create a website design with the look and feel of Edward Tufte's books and handouts. Tufteâ€™s style is known for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set typography.<!--more--> The idea for this project is essentially cribbed wholesale from Tufte and R Markdown's Tufte Handout format{% sidenote 'One' 'See [tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/](https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/) and [rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html)' %} This page is an adaptation of the [Tufte Handout PDF](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/examples/tufte-handout.pdf).
