      <description>السلام عليكم و رحمة الله و بركاته
Here I will list Arabic learning resources, primarily based on Dr. V. Abdur Raheem&amp;rsquo;s program. I also include any extra reading materials and cartoons as well.
Medina Series This series was created by Dr. V. Abdur Raheem and is famous worldwide. Its fame is most probably due to it being used at the Islamic University in Medina, Saudi Arabia.
